I had these edited last thursday, exported, and then forgot about them. This was the week before we left for europe for vacation. Anyway, just before that happened, Kawan came back to town. Not just for a visit this time, but really moving back. It''s really great to have him around, at least as much as we manage to see each other, being like, busy people with Important Things™ to do like having a job so we can sleep indoors and making silly art or other interesting objects.  

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1530/0003.jpg)

I feel like I used to see people more often? Maybe this is the last bit of pandemic recovery, re-finding my social calendar. People matter, and I miss seeing a lot of them. Towards that end, tomorrow there''s an Odd Salon, which is always a highlight, just a bunch of delightful folks. Anyway, if you actually want to hang out, get @ me.

Drive, then fly. Palm Springs is a weird little town. There are these huge mountains, snow on top, and it seems like every single architect that''s worked there in the past century or so has asked themselves, how can I block the view the most? How can I take the best thing about this place, all this great nature, and get in its way? 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1420/0002.jpg)

I''m not mad about it. Most places are either like that or empty. LA, on the other side of the mountains, is like that. I dunno, something about the scale of Palm Springs is off. These were all shot the day after the last post, getting to the airport and getting on a plane to Oklahoma. Which didn''t seem like the best idea even then. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1420/0003.jpg)

I''ll save you the suspense, though: we made it through the whole trip without getting COVID, mostly because we didn''t do a lot and wore n95 masks when we had to be inside and/or around people. I didn''t get to see my family because they all had omicron, and same for my friends. Going to a bar to see who I run into, which is normally a favorite home activity of mine, was out of the question.  

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1420/0004.jpg)

Even with all that caution, I feel like I''ve used up all the reserves of good luck I might''ve had stored. Going to just stay home for a while, let this wave pass. I''ve got plenty of photos on the backlog to post...

Just a quick post; these are from the first day I had the new camera (Leica M11) and took it out in the world a little. My little walk for sanity, as I''ve come to think of it. I''ve had it a month now, and I''ve got some opinions. With one notable exception, everything is better than the M10 was. Resolution, obviously, but that''s not even that important to me; I''ve had enough pixels since the d700 gave me 12MP. The battery is bigger, such that a whole day''s shooting will likely only require one. The menus are simplified, easy to use, and the wifi connection to my phone seems more reliable, too. The optical viewfinder is the same, excellent, the just best rangefinder. Live View is more responsive, both on the back display and through the Visoflex EVF (More on that in a minute). The shutter lag is the same, or at least I can''t tell a difference; if the camera is ready, and you''re fast enough, it''ll get the shot. 
 
# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1506/0002.jpg)

That is the camera''s one flaw though, that you have to make sure it''s awake. you turn it on and have to wait 3-5 seconds for it to be ready to take a picture, and what''s worse, the shutter opens and the viewfinder lines light up but it actually needs another half second to be ready. 3 seconds is an eternity. And the wake from sleep is also slow, on the order of 2ish seconds. Leica: please, dear god, figure your shit out. Nikon, canon, sony, even my dang Ricoh GR3, all get this right, ready to go in under half a second. The nikon is ready to shoot faster than I can roll my finger from the on switch to the shutter button. I feel like this is something I could fix with a couple weeks with the source code ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

A could other minor things: the internal memory is nice to have and has already saved my bacon once.

That means selecting something that''s tough enough, but not too heavy. Cotton canvas is out, as is leather; natural fibers rot if you expose them to moisture for too long; so if you''re in the tropics for 6 months, take something synthetic. 

In a lot of the bags I make, I use the woven Dyneema melange. It''s incredibly strong, cut resistant, waterproof, and lighter than nylon of the same thickness. The sort of heather gray look is nice, as long as you give it some accents. I have in the past used Dyneema Composite, or DCF, but it has problems with pinholes forming after a while, _and_ it looks like crap, _and_ it''s really hard to sew, so I''ve mostly sworn off it.

I''ll also use a nylon canvas, similar to Cordura. All the neon highlights in the lineup on the home page are 1000d nylon canvas, with a waterproof coating (actually at present I don''t even have any uncoated fabrics in stock), as is any actual black fabric (the [Businessman''s Lunch](https://mills.studio/post/businessman%27s_lunch) is a good example). 

For linings, I''ve come to really like Gridstop, which is a brand of ripstop nylon, lightweight but reasonably tough. I also use a generous amount of hook and loop fastener, generic but strong, to hold the dividers. The foam padding is usually dense craft foam, although I''ve got some cork that I might experiment with, too.

All of the webbing I use is severe overkill in terms of strength, but I feel the wider shoulder straps help carrying the dense loads that land in camera bags. I use tex 75 (upholstery weight) nylon thread, and in critical areas (such as straps), kevlar thread of the same weight, which is twice as strong. Some of the hardware is custom, some off the shelf. The aluminum triglides I use were fabricated for me after I went through 3 or four different plastic ones and couldn''t find ones I liked.

well it''s after midnight again (it''s literally always after midnight), and it''s time to blog... I started this post like a week ago, and then couldn''t decide what pictures to post. still hitting stumbling blocks I''ve set up for myself. The edits are too big, so the posts would be too big. I''m forgetting the first rule of blogging, which is always be blogging. The second rule, which I''m also breaking, is talking about not blogging (getting distracted by whys instead of doing the damn thing. well. anyway.

These are from the flight down to LA when we were going to Santa Fe over xmas break. I''m pretty sure I haven''t posted them? I _did_ allow myself the liberty of slightly cropping these first two. I know, it''s kinda blasphemous, but when you''re in a banking aircraft shooting out of a tiny window, it''s a lot to keep track of the horizon. Pilots even have a [special little gyro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_indicator) they watch instead of watching for the actual horizon. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1549/0003.jpg)

Then we flew over LA, where there was much traffic and I was glad, once again, to not be in it. The next flight was over huge stretches of empty desert. The Mohave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts, just the harshest, most beautiful places, but nothing to see at night. And then we were in Santa Fe to see family. More on that later.

This was back in the halcyon days, when there was no Delta in the US, and in fact it was months away in any case. Everybody I knew was getting jabbed and so we could safely hang out again. The first priority was to get out to Oklahoma and see my family. On that same trip, I got to see a bunch of my OKC friends; this is one of those nights. I''m working through the backlog, and since I''ve published a lot of landscape-y shots lately, I figured I could break it up with some portraits. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1421/0002.jpg)

On impulse, I pulled down my copy of _The Decisive Moment_ to page through and re-read the essay at the beginning. "Twenty-five years have passed since I started to look through my viewfinder. But I regard myself as an amateur, though I am no longer a dilettante." The photos inside, still teaching me things. I''m 100% a ''decisive moment'' photographer, which really means I was born about 50 years too late. I guess as long as I''m applying it within the context of now, and not trying to replicate Bresson''s or Winogrand''s photographs, then it should all come out fine, yeah?

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1421/0003.jpg)

Something I''ve been thinking about lately, that I got from a guy on youtube: the reward is the pictures. Most of this stuff, it''s going to be here on the blog for a while, and the very best, the ones that are part of a project, will make it into a print-on-demand book that then is printed tens of times, if that (there are, to my knowledge, three copies of my last book in existence). So, making the pictures better be enough. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1421/0004.jpg)

I shot these, I''m pretty sure, with the Mitakon Speedmaster, a 50mm 0.95 lens. Definitely some softness and veiling flare to several of them. It''s also possible that I switched back to my Summilux when we got back to the house for the after party, just looking at these. Also possible, givent they allow smoking inside, that the veiling flare and loss of detail is just what the conditions allowed in that club that night. I need to play with that lens some more, is what I''m saying. I also have a version of it in 35mm X mount, for my fuji. I also really like that lens? They''re both interesting to use in daylight, wide open with ND filters.

These are from the trip to OKC last month; I was staying in Mesta Park (well, not the park but the neighborhood). Decided to walk and get some dinner, and there was a huge storm cloud off to the east. If you''re not familiar with the weather in the middle, you might think that was cause for alarm, but almost as sure as water flowing down hill, storms in Oklahoma move west to east. This one was odd in that it was moving mostly to the south, but with a slight drift east also. I didn''t get rained on at all.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1508/0002.jpg)

I should probably make a list of stuff to post here. I had a bunch of ideas for posts, photos I could put up, but that was a week ago and I have no idea what they were. I have a few photos from more recently, and probably a ton on the camera, and the stuff from mexico city, which will probably be two posts even though I know it would be better to make a really tight edit and put them all out in one post. One for the city and one for the pyramids seems fair, right? And then there''s a bunch of stuff in the backlog I haven''t touched. So. yeah. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1508/0005.jpg)

I used to use the quick collection as a ''stack'' to pull from, but now I don''t have that luxury. I have to make my own stack. I think the improvements to ingestion are probably worth it, but remembering stuff is hard. maybe I should make a blog notebook of ideas for things to write and photo sets I should post? They never line up that well, but maybe I could make the themes overlap a little.

What a week, huh? I started it sunday, realizing that all my 2021 pictures were just sitting on my desktop, not copied to my backup storage or to the cloud. Then I realized that my network adapter stopped working when I upgraded my OS maybe a month ago. So, I got a new adapter, got things backed up, and while I was at it, found the missing pictures from 2008 (the whole year failed to copy to my backup drive when I was initially migrating to it way back in 2018, and I only noticed recently). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1422/0002.jpg)

Whenever I plug in the old hard drives, there''s always a bit of faffing about, looking at old pictures. There are versions of things that have gotten corrupted, sometimes in interesting ways. Like you can tell some bits got flipped in one spot in the raw file, and then the file from there on is color shifted. it''s weird, and most of the  time just a pain in the ass. Luckily, it only seems to happen to old nikon files, and I always have two copies, so all the ones that have gone to the storage appliance are good. For now. Bitrot will come for us all eventually. 

Anyway, I also realized that with the OS upgrade my displays weren''t calibrated any more, and spent a good half an hour fixing that. So hopefully the colors and tones look good, and if they don''t, maybe calibrate your screen?

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1422/0003.jpg)

Looking at the old photos gave me an idea for a feature, though. Import and edit a folder and tell the story of what was happening as I remember it, kind of like a blog post after the fact (or 15 years after or whatever). Does that sound interesting? Or maybe just like, the most compelling single photo from the old stuff, without explanation. Maybe nobody but me cares about these old photos any more. That''s possible, too.

These photos (in this post) aren''t of anything, per se. Just four random ones off the top of the backlog that I didn''t want to let pass without posting. Will probably post something more interesting or narrative on the next post (or maybe it''ll be a bunch of parking lots in Oklahoma from last spring, I have that post almost prepped too).

Prints on roll paper though, so at least I can go as long as needed in one dimension.

Anyway, photos. It was midsummer in oklahoma when I took these. The sky always puts on a show there. So much was weirdly unfinished, kind of on pause. I was definitely working the questions this trip. I think maybe I talked about those over in my newsletter, but as they''re proprietary to the workshop I learned them in, I won''t blab too much here. (Also don''t worry about the newsletter, it''s more or less dead. Blogs are the future!). Actually, it''s late, I''ma just push post and go to bed.

Anyway. Working on trying to find financing to buy another Leica. Shooting with it doesn’t endear me to it, but working on these files sure does. I don’t know how, exactly, to make this work, because consumer financing at the point of sale has ridiculous interest rates; highway robbery by another name. If I had a business entity, it’s possible I could lease it, and that’s a bit more reasonable. Might look into that a bit more.

For some reason, I decided to do a sort of cleanse this year for driftwood; I only took my "pool toy" (a nikonos V underwater camera rated to 5 atmospheres of pressure), a film rangefinder, and my little Ricoh GR. Owing to the film and different (some might say chaotic) camera assortment, all of these are out of order. Or, at best, in vibes only order. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1538/0002.jpg)

This year was a bit of an expansion; we had maybe 15 people at peak? 20? There is no census at driftwood. It was, as usual, a few days on the water with just music and good people.

These photos were the result of being in the right place at the right time. My neighbor [Lauren](https://www.thespaldingcompany.com/) was producing this tour and this was the last show. I think that was her role; the music world is a mystery to me, especially how the business side gets done, but she was running the show. We had met in the months (Years? God time is weird) prior, and had neighborly drinks in her back yard a couple times. Lauren knew I was a photographer, and so when her photog bailed at the last minute, she asked if I wanted to come shoot. Free house show in the city, with an all access pass, put on by one of the coolest people I know? Say less, as the kids say. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1465/0002.jpg)

There was an opener, [Coco and Breezy](https://www.instagram.com/cocoandbreezy), but apart from the first pic, I didn''t get a ton of good shots of them. I was mainly there for the headliner, LP Giobbi. I shot for basically her whole set. Up and down the stairs, moving around the stage, doing the whole thing. Two cameras, the Nikon with the 24-120 and the Leica, shooting away for a couple hours. I think I took a cigar break in the middle, went outside and burned one, sat and rested my knees. I am not a kid, and my body makes sure I know it.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1465/0001.jpg)

Lauren and LP also co-founded a non-profit, [Femme House](https://www.thisisfemmehouse.com/), which is worth mentioning because I think this show was a Femme House show. (Edit to add: pretty sure it was).  

> FEMME HOUSE fosters more equitable opportunity for women and gender-expansive individuals in the technical and behind the scenes areas of music. We are creating the future producers, mixers, engineers, DJs, artists, and executives of the industry by providing education and scholarships, cultivating community, propagating visual representation, and offering professional development opportunities. 

It reminds me a bit of ElixirBridge, which was all about bringing in underrepresented groups into my industry, also through free classes. Femme House is way cooler and has a better web site, but I digress. Anyway. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1465/0004.jpg)

I did make a classic blunder with these, in that the tour manager (not Lauren, some dude) asked for 50 photos, and I dutifully made an edit of approximately 50 photos (out of about 600 exposures). They were all passable, but really there are only so many photos you can get of someone performing; any more and I''m repeating myself and muddying the record with lesser pictures. The 9 here is probably the edit I should have sent, maybe 15 or 20 max. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1465/0005.jpg)

I sent them 5o, unfortunately, and I never heard anything and never saw them get used even for a social post. I didn''t feel great about it at the time, not because I recognized my mistake, but because I thought they didn''t like the pictures. I spent the last ten months or so thinking, oh well, screwed the pooch on that one, I guess those photos weren''t any good. Then last night I figured the time had come to look at them and see if I could salvage anything for a blog post. I don''t care what they think: I fucking killed it on this one. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1465/0006.jpg)

It''s also possible that because this was the last stop on the tour that these photos just didn''t matter or get looked at at all. Maybe they''re vastly different from the visual style of the other tour photos and so didn''t get used; I didn''t have time to look for any of the tour press at the time so I have no idea if these work with the rest. Could be a lot of things. Lauren moved away coincidentally around then and we haven''t had backyard whiskeys since, so I may never know. At least now, through the magic of blogging, these get to be seen.

one thing led to another and then there I was, in downtown brooklyn. It was pride weekend, by chance, but I decided to avoid the crowds and mostly just chilled for the four days I was there. I got in late on Thursday, took the train in from JFK, walked from javits to my airbnb (rip, airbnb in nyc, it was great while it lasted). Then got up and went to EMPEX NYC, the nominal reason for my visit. Well, that and it made the hop to AMS shorter and easier (and those photos are also coming, I just got to these first because... reasons).

New York in the springtime. This was the trip that I finally took friend Emmie''s advice and acquainted myself with the bodega sandwich. I don''t think I had a single slice of pizza the whole trip? The sandwiches, they are good.  My sleep schedule was mostly fucked the whole time, falling asleep at like 3am and waking up in the early afternoon, so that affected it somewhat, and then also there was the problem that there just weren''t any slice places nearby where I was staying. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1524/0003.jpg)

Made the trip into Manhattan to see the Popcorn and some [Tabs](http://www.todayintabs.com/) discord folks, had a nice little picnic in Washington Square Park. There was some sort of Hare Krishna thing going on, felt weird and a little cult-y, especially the drum circle. Sitting on the grass on the other side of the park from the gathering was nice, though.

Then we wandered to a local watering hole, had some drinks, went and had dinner at some Thai place that was probably fine but I honestly don''t remember that much of (it''s been three months, a lot has happened). Then we stood in line for ice cream somewhere else in SoHo, which was really good but I have almost no idea where we were; everyone I was hanging out was a neighborhood veteran and it was my first time anywhere near NYU.

Then back to brooklyn, and it''s wild how a couple blocks from the tall skinny billionaire''s nests it''s just brownstones and apartments. I was in a fourth floor walk up, tiny one bedroom that belonged to someone in musical theater who was, sort of ironically, in wine country in california for the same dates I was in NYC. A lot of stairs, but otherwise a fine place to sleep and stow my gear. I worked on monday and then I was off again, to Amsterdam and another layer of jet lag....

One nice surprise is that his whole band is just as energetic as he was, and also all of them got some nice moments to shine too. Really nice touches.

We got home and I passed out, but I woke up at 4:30 and couldn’t sleep, so I got up to edit. My ears are still ringing, but I’m happy. A good way to spend a birthday.

The place is not <em>really</em> a restaurant. There is technically food, and while I’m sure, in that Japanese way, just like food from 7-11, it’s perfectly fine, it’s not a place you go for food. There are good drinks, strong. How can I describe it? It’s sort of like what happened to opera when they mixed in rock to make rock opera, but done to Kabuki theater and then with a shit ton of LEDs and shiny costumes and sort of real robots? Wild stories of nature versus technology, silly dancing, and a fire breathing dragon, briefly. Everything is dialed to 11, and then multiplied. I could hardly keep up, and I was sitting the whole time. 

And then there was a brief calm period, with rave dancers and lasers. Then, to giant silver robots came out and danced. Then, just because obviously that wasn’t enough, there was a fish show. No, not Phish. Fish. Well, an aquatic themed dance number, complete with more giant platforms with drums and dancers. Really, a hell of a show.

This was a party I was something like four years late to. That is, Casey has it every year, and every year on 3/14 since the first one I was invited to, something prevented me from going. COVID lockdown was the first year (although the party happened, I had a small fever that morning from _something_ and stayed away out of an abundance of caution), I think the next year I was somewhere for work, etc etc. I''m very lucky that my friends tolerate me, I know. This year I forgot yet again, and scheduled a trip to Texas that week, but as luck would have it I was landing at SFO in time to go directly to the party. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1553/0002.jpg)

Touched down, texted Sophie the wrong address from my cab, got there and was greeted by just the nicest, warmest group of folks you could want after a couple days away from home. And I want to say soup? And pie. A lot of pie. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1553/0003.jpg)

Sophie texted to say she was there and I went down and she wasn''t and we figured out she was at the wrong place, and so got her headed to the right place, went down again, let her in and went to park the car while she went up to get some wine to relieve the effects of San Francisco rush hour. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1553/0004.jpg)

We sat, we talked, pie was had. And I marked my dang calendar for next year.

Do not allow them the space. Do not allow them to make you afraid to go to the park on a saturday. There is hard work ahead of us; there is much healing and compassion that will be needed, but this is the first step. Show the nazis they’re not welcome in our town, our state, our country.

If we have 10 times more people, then they will run away, afraid of what they have awakened.</p> <p>So: do not allow them to occupy that space in your fear centers. Do not think that ignoring violence will make it go away. There are more people in any medium-sized city right now that can show up to oppose them than there are avowed fascists in the whole USA.

This was January 2024. I went to the top of the backlog, the oldest pictures, got rid of a couple stragglers from 2023 (although there''s some stuff from our Christmas in Santa Fe I need to see if I ever posted and put those up if I haven''t) and anyway these were what was at the top. Met Cason, Ryan, Joseph (not pictured but I''m pretty sure he was there) and Nayara out at Pangloss in Sonoma, had wine and things, and then went back where C&R were staying in Cotati. They were renting a little cottage in a friend''s yard, and we sat by a fire and listened to music and watched the stars. Miss those guys. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1575/0002.jpg)

Anyway. I kinda realized that if I want to get through the backlog of posts I need to be posting, and I don''t have to have a little essay with every post. Nobody reads them, I think?

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/water_boarding_party/1188/0002.jpg)

Actually, everyone pouring got poured on too, so it was at least sort of fair. And there was a "safe word," in the form of a hammer that the person on the board would drop when they''d had enough. Which was usually seconds. Nobody made it very long.

Right now, you''re thinking to yourself, "Did MM get waterboarded?" and the answer is a definite no. I drowned <a href="http://payingoffmyloans.blogspot.com/2008/01/nine-times-ive-nearly-died-pt-1.html">once before</a> (note, the near-death count has gone up since then), was resuscitated, and for about six years of my childhood I didn''t go near the water, and I took very shallow baths. So, I don''t need to experience simulated drowning, I''ve had the real thing.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/water_boarding_party/1188/0004.jpg)

Other than the torture, it was a pretty standard evening, with a lot of beer and liquor consumed, and crashing out on the couch. I hadn''t been letting myself get that drunk, but once in a while it''s fun. At least I didn''t black out.

I just did it for my suitcase, and it’s got me thinking about packing, and lists; what I forgot, and what I could have left behind.</p> <p>First is the list of stuff I wish I’d remembered. I forgot my travel towel (don’t know where it is, in fact) and it’s super useful, even if the hotel/hostel/cabin/tent (etc) has a towel for every person. I especially miss mine when doing sink laundry. I also forgot to re-stock some of the consumables in my Dopp kit, notably the cotton pads I use for my face (I’m 32 years old and still have acne like a teenager; after a couple golden years in my 20s of low maintenance skin, it’s a wash and moisturize twice a day or I break out). That’s about it for things I miss. Total cost of about 6 oz. I also sort of wish I’d brought a water filter, but I haven’t been uncomfortable without it; the steripen has worked the one time I needed it, but the water still tasted pretty bad.</p> <p>I also wish, just a bit, that I’d brought the larger camera bag. It fits my iPad and keyboard, and also a water bottle and a bunch of other stuff. The little bag isn’t the worst thing to happen, but I wish I had both options. That would also have bumped me up to my larger carry on, which would have meant I need packing cubes… etc. Oh: I also wished, several times, for a 10L dry bag to stash my camera gear in. And a non-GoPro waterproof camera. Again, I would have needed the larger backpack; I’m in a 30L daypack from Topo similar to <a href="https://topodesigns.com/collections/bags/products/travel-bag">this one</a>; the big one is max-carryon sized, about 45L, <a href="https://meipacks.myshopify.com/collections/carry-ons/products/mei-voyageur">from MEI</a>.</p> <p>Things I could have left at home: Binoculars, brought on the off chance that there would be clear skies and less light pollution. Neither of these things are true. Jeans: This was a guess on my part that I would be comfortable in them. The heat down here is way too much for pants. The tropics are an exception to my no shorts rule. Also: the 50mm lens; I haven’t bothered to carry it at all.</p> <p>A few items I’ve picked up here that I’ll be bringing on my next trip to the tropics: A rash guard, made of wicking fabric, long sleeved. Gives about 30 SPF, very cooling when it’s wet, perfect for going in the water. Medication: I ran out of my prescriptions for blood pressure, and had to get them refilled here. The local pharmacy had two of the four, enough to prevent me from having an embolism or stroke or whatever.</p>', '2020-04-04 21:07:30', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'the_things_i_wish_i_carried', '2017-04-27 21:08:54', 1, false, NULL, false, '{the_things_i_wish_i_carried}');

So we got to Santa Fe and had lunch with the family that was gathered in town. I''ll post those photos eventually maybe, but I''m feeling these right now. After lunch, there was a storm moving in, to dump a couple inches of snow on the town (more up on the mountain). Incredible light. So I grabbed the nikon and ran down to the river. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1550/0002.jpg)

OK, maybe I didn''t run. Walked quickly. But the clouds! Wild clouds. I really love Santa Fe, just for the light they get there. I mean, also the green chile and the people and the art and the smell of the desert, especially after the rain. Mountains, love mountains too. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1550/0003.jpg)

The weather there though seems to come in wild rages; cold and wind and clouds bursting across the landscape. I was out for half an hour, walking along the banks of the river and up on the trail. I started and the clouds were pretty far off; by the time I was heading back, they were overhead and the first flurries were falling. It felt a bit like the late summer/early fall monsoons in that way, coming in fast. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1550/0004.jpg)

This storm actually didn''t even stick for very long. It wasn''t cold enough I don''t think? Sure felt cold, despite my layers.

What can I say about Driftwood, year two? It was kind of perfect, in that way that throwing the same party all over again never is. I suppose the setup is part of it, so I''ll start there. In the hottest part of the year, out on the Sacramento/San Joaquin River Delta ("The Delta" to its friends), we all got together again for a weekend of swimming in and floating on the water, music and friends and good times. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1507/0002.jpg)

To get there, you drive onto a car ferry because there''s no bridge. There was cell phone signal this year, but it''s pretty far removed from the world. Haul in your water, food, ice, tent, floaties, party favors, and haul out your trash. Our friend Jack has a plot on Bradford Island he graciously lets us come out to. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1507/0003.jpg)

Jack''s place burned over the winter; the outhouse he had was gone, and a lot of his infrastructure was damaged, but he still had some solar, and threw up a new bathroom in a better spot. It was a lot clearer this year. kind of bigger open space, as opposed to just having a little area cleared. The main structure he had, an elevated deck and cabin, also made it through the fire, so we still had a place to cook and put up the PA. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1507/0004.jpg)

It was also the first time [Sophia](https://sophia.red) played a set in ''public''. Half an hour, in front of a dozen people, but I think it counts. She played for... 45 minutes? But all recordings of sets at Driftwood are cursed, so you''ll just have to imagine a 45 minute drum and bass set. Or you can go to this [SoundCloud Mix](https://on.soundcloud.com/mbCcc) where she recreated it later.

Speaking of cursed recordings, OTHA played for four? six? hours after that, just a truly epic journey of a set. We laughed, we cried, we sat and stared at the stars. Then, his hard drive crashed. Possibly after we left the island, I''m not clear on the finer points of it all. Technology. So you''ll also have to imagine the rest, too.

Been a while since I rapped at ya... These are from last fall, because I have once again let my backlog get way ahead of me... there are so many things from this year that I haven''t posted. Porto I didn''t post yet because it''s hard to edit down to something coherent and postable, but here I am posting anyway. Probably will be 2-3 posts? I''m trying.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1557/0002.jpg)

This was kind of my half of our big trip last year; we try to go on a trip in the fall, and 22/23 were both europe, with Sun and Bass, a music festival, for the first week, and the second week usually somewhere else: [previously](https://matt.pictures/post/first_day_in_florence)[ Florence](https://matt.pictures/post/last_day_out_in_florence). I already posted the [Sun n Bass](https://matt.pictures/post/sun_and_bass_again_%282023%29) photos a while back, but never got around to these, mostly because it''s a lot to get through and I always had a quick win that I could post and get on with things, and then... a lot of other things happened.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1557/0003.jpg)

The first thing that happened is that I got serious about finishing San Pablo. I made a final edit, printed work prints, stared at them for two months, and finally sequenced them in what I''ve been calling ''vibe order''. Then I put them in a really simply laid out photo book and had that printed through Blurb. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1557/0004.jpg)

Then I decided for this fall, to take a [cross country motorcycle trip](https://bigempty.photos/archive/) instead of flying to Europe. That took a couple of months to prepare for, and a bunch of stuff that would normally live on here ended up over there. I may copy those posts over, or I may make a static site for it, not sure. I need to stop sending buttondown $30/mo to not send emails, for sure though. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1557/0005.jpg)

I did that, published a newsletter post every day I was out, and then when I got back re-formatted everything into a magazine that I still need to to quite a bit of work to. I think I don''t like the way I designed it at all, and I might make it a small landscape book instead. Anyway.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1557/0006.jpg)

Enough words for now. More Porto next time.

once again posting old shit. this was last... march? before it dried out in the spring. Roy''s. I was there with Damaris, Grant, Sophie''s mom, and of course Sophie. Good day in the woods. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1532/0002.jpg)

I''ve been neglecting my photography. building lots of things though; finished the keyboard i''m typing this on (typos are my fault, the board is great), mostly finished another small bag, shaped a couple knife blanks and hardened them. doing stuff for christmas and for myself. The house is a mess. Now that I''ve spent three days neglecting it I''ll have to spend two getting it back in shape. Laundry. Dishes. That sort of thing. If I time it right tomorrow I''ll still have a couple hours to go and finish that bag. Then I need to start designing the next one, which is a big departure for me. A backpack, for a big honkin'' lens. Not mine. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1532/0003.jpg)

In fact, I think started thinking about this backpack on this day, back in March. So, if you want a bag from me, that''s the kind of lead time I have. About 9 months to start patterning and prototyping. 

That may get worse here pretty soon. Gonna have some things going on in 2024 that will oblige me to convalesce. Take it very easy. I''m going to be getting a new kidney, and at some point they''ll also have to take the old ones out. Yes, I know that''s not normal. Anyway, the hope is that after all that, plus recovery, plus an amount of exercise, I''ll have some measure of my old energy and strength back. No more gout, for one. 

Anyway. This is a very wordy post! don''t get used to it. or do. maybe I''ll write about the experience of getting a transplant. maybe do some kind of photo thing with it. we''ll see.

Yeah, yeah. I’m a year behind ‘the current moment’ (este momento, agora, hoje). I think the concept of being behind the moment is unbelievably [sweaty](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/the-spectrum?s=r). There’s an amount of urgency to some photo work, that is, news pictures, mainly. News is New. but I haven’t done news work in a long time, and maybe it’s time to let go of that neurosis? 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1429/L1006235.jpg)

This week (the current one, April 2022) was a good one. I spoke at [Odd Salon](https://oddsalon.com/) Underdog, and realized at the end of the show, when they were announcing the next show, that I won’t make the last show. I’m on the road that week. I don’t mind, the show we put together was great.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1429/L1006249.jpg)

If you don’t know about Odd Salon, it’s 6 speakers, ~10 minutes each, who tell stories from the odd corners of History, Science, Art, and adventure. I spoke about the photographer Atget; there were other talks about America''s First Suicide Hotline, the town of Rough and Ready, CA, Notker the Stammerer (a beloved monk who invented early music notation and wrote beautiful poetry), how Notre Dame (the one in South Bend) beat the KKK with potaties, and Mary Seacole (a nurse from Jamaica who travelled the world, including to the Crimean War). Friend Casey was the curator for the evening, and did such an amazing job weaving together all those stories.

Couple days ago (thursday?) I had to go into the city to pick up an air compressor. If you don''t know what that is, it''s a big shop tool. Powers other kinds of tools, like nail guns and die grinders and pretty much everything else. Nice to have around the shop. Anyway, I looked at the route and instead of taking me across the bay bridge, like I''m used to, it said that it was 10 minutes faster to go through marin, to 101, and then south over the Golden Gate. So that''s what I did.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1517/0002.jpg)

Now normally, I would look at a set of directions like that and say, oh, it''s probably not worth saving ten minutes, or, surely it can''t be that much better, but this time, I''d just gotten a rented camera in the mail. I''m trying out the Nikon Z8 over the weekend, and so a creative ''shortcut'' was just what the doctor ordered.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1517/0003.jpg)

The z8 is a remarkable camera. The autofocus system is incredible, but also incredibly complex. I never really got into all the focus tracking continuous blah blah, even back when I shot an F5, so this thing might as well be an alien space ship from that perspective. When I put it in single point servo mode, though, it''s incredibly fast and accurate.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1517/0004.jpg)

These pictures were all shot with that camera and the 40mm f/2 nikkor. This sample I like a bit better than the one that I rented with the Z7 when I tried that camera. From a moving car, sometimes things are a little blurry. I''ve always liked shooting from the car, driving or not, and this camera does it really well.  

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1517/0005.jpg)

Everything about it is fast as fuck. turns on fast (looking at you, Leica), switches between back lcd and viewfinder fast, shoots 20 dang frames a second if you''re into that sort of thing. The exposure meter hysteresis, the time it takes to react to big swings in light values, is also super fast. This is important when the camera is in your lap, and you try to quick-draw to get a picture of something you''re passing on the road. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1517/0006.jpg)

After this little jaunt, I put on an adapter that lets me use the camera with my m-mount lenses, and it''s actually also really good with those, just like, manually focusing. I wish there was some kind of focus confirmation, instead of just the edge detection it has. Maybe there is and I haven''t found that setting yet! who knows. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1517/0007.jpg)

Anyway, yeah. more as it develops... probably back to leicaposting soon.

For those that don''t know, Driftwood is an annual gathering out in the [Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento%E2%80%93San_Joaquin_River_Delta), on [Bradford Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Island). Reachable by car ferry, there''s no running water or very much electricity; we sort of bootstrap the whole thing with stuff we bring in. A lot of people contribute various things, like hauling in porta potties, or a generator, or they help organize. I bring my cameras. The point, although we call it a ''festival'', is to get together and make art with a bunch of cool people.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1571/0003.jpg)

Look, I know this is a lot of pictures. Driftwood has expanded from a weekend to four days. So there''s a lot of stuff that happens. The big edit was like 120 pictures. So. I did cut quite a few. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1571/0004.jpg)

There are communal dinners, music late into the night, camping, swimming in the Delta. We sit out on the dock/in the water during the day, when it''s hot, and then come back to Jack''s plot (it''s also Jack''s dock) for dinner and music and dancing. Originally, the whole thing was powered off Jack''s solar array, but in recent years upgrades to our PA system have required more watts than he has on tap at night. There are batteries, but not quite enough of them. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1571/0005.jpg)

Because Sophie helps organize, we went out on Thursday. This year, me and Sophie rented an RV, sort of experimentally, because AC is nice. It was a pretty big hassle though, and I don''t know that we''ll be doing it again. The ferry plus the drive out there was just a lot. Although, getting there and basically being set up in 15 minutes, instead of having to set up a tent was pretty nice. There was an amount of other setup to do, of course. Lights, rugs, DJ booth, you know, just the essentials.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1571/0006.jpg)
 
The second day, there was a really amazing sunset, complete with double rainbow. I got a picture of it, but pictures of rainbows never really do it justice, so you''ll just have to trust me. I did get a bunch of the sunset that night from the top of the levee, though. Jack and Benny both came up in one of the carts to see. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1571/0007.jpg)

I really should take field notes at these things, I have no idea what order these photos should go in. The whole experience was magical and amazing, even with the rain the second day. In fact, it made the whole thing a little less hot; it can be really unbearable sometimes, you know?  

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1571/0008.jpg)

There were a lot of moments I didn''t get pictures of, because I too was lost in the moment. Joseph put down some foam and blankets and pillows in the back of his truck, and parked it so it was close to the music, where people could chill and look up at the stars. That was a good one. Or when someone brought watermelon down to the dock to share just as it was getting hot. Or like, probably a hundred other little moments. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1571/0009.jpg)

Anyway. Here are the rest of the pictures.

Shot these one day back in... December? Went up to Santa Rosa to meet Cason and Ryan for brunch at the Flamingo. I had the edit ready a couple weeks ago and then forgot about it. Been working on the San Pablo edit. I had some vague vibes-based categories and then got some help from my friend [Michela](https://www.instagram.com/mvatcheva/) to put them in order... unfortunately it kind of fell flat when I looked at it again with Sophie. I think the groupings made it too much of the same thing all at once. So now they''re shuffled together again and I need to try to sequence them again.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1552/0002.jpg)

Speaking of putting things in order, I''m also working on a bunch of different stuff for the motorcycle trip this fall. I picked up ten yards of high-viz yellow (if you''ve seen the yellow I use in most of my bags, it''s that) to make some saddlebags, and I''m trying to figure out what camping gear and other things to take. I realized it would be a much better trip if I didn''t do it out-and-back, instead shipping the bike to Minnesota and taking the full time just to make my way back home. I need to get a different set of tires on the new moto, and probably half a dozen other things I''m forgetting. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1552/0003.jpg)

I''m also thinking about doing some kind of email newsletter while I''m on the road, maybe a few editions before then. Modeled after Craig Mod''s walking practice. The road versions will be photos and field notes from that day; if I made a couple posts before then it''d be preparation, what I''m taking, how I''m routing, stuff like that. It''d be difficult to do I think, but pretty rewarding to have that record at the end. And I know at least some people would like to be able to follow along, so there''s that. But I have to come up with a name for it and pick a newsletter platform that isn''t for fascists, but I have a couple to pick from. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1552/0004.jpg)

Anyway, these clouds: just sort of bursting with energy. There''s a pattern here in the bay where it''ll rain for the first part of the day, and then gradually it''ll kind of clear up, but in the middle of the day the clouds do this wild thing. In other places, you see clouds like this before the weather comes in, but here it''s often the opposite. A quirk of living out here on the west coast, I suppose. Surrounded by mountains and ocean.

Took these flying home from that trip to OKC last year. Honestly I''m still processing all the shit that happened in 2021, and 2022 is half over. 2022 is definitely a rebuilding year; take apart your bones and put ''em back together. Make a new life out of the parts on hand, maybe. So much is broken, but we''re still here. Now I''m just rambling free associations.

That''s all, except to say I never really noticed just how much falloff this lens (my 50mm summilux) has. Maybe I went a bit too far with the contrast expansion? ah well, it''s a blog, who cares? As [the blogfather](http://busblog.tonypierce.com/2004/06/how-to-blog-by-tony-pierce-110-1.html/) said, "hit publish and forget about it".

Still trying to get used to this new keyboard. A [keyboard.io model 100](https://shop.keyboard.io/pages/model100). it''s pretty nice, but I feel like i''m typing uphill. sorta weird. anywho...

Took these photos late last summer, when I found myself downtown a lot, for unspecified reasons. ask me about it over drinks some time, if we ever can have drinks together again. the optimism of the end of summer 2021 really was foolish in hindsight, but can you blame us? we were cooped up inside for something like 18 months. by that time everyone had had at least one scare pre-vaccine where they thought they might''ve gotten it. The accumulated stress of it got to be too much. of course, eventually the varaiants came for us and just completely squashed that optimism. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1432/0003.jpg)

For a while though, maybe 6 weeks, there were bright, sunny days, where I got out and rode my bike almost every day, where I took my camera on lunch walks to see the blue sky. I gotta say, it''s something I really miss, so much so that I''ve considered getting a co-working desk downtown, just so I can go a place that isn''t my basement to work. As it is, I spend a lot of my hours in the chair I''m in right now. It''s a nice chair, but I can''t stand up all the way. The ceiling is 6 feet, and I''m 6''2". But, there''s the ongoing pandemic to consider, and I don''t really care to go somewhere where I''ll be accumulating more risk. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1432/0004.jpg)

anyway. next time, I promise I''ll talk about something more upbeat.

So last fall, while I was in Sardinia, I took a little side trip. The festival we were at was at the north end of the island, in a little town called San Teodoro. From there, I took a bus to the train station in Olbia, and the train took me all the way across the island. I don''t want to belabor the point, but I could take a bus and train, about 6 hours total, to get to a place that was about a three hour drive away. Whole island has the population of less than the greater bay area, and yet somehow high speed rail in california ''doesn''t make sense''? They''ve played us for fools.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1539/0010.jpg)

Anyway. These aren''t in any particular order, I exported them in numerical order and then they got randomized when I uploaded them. No big deal. I was in the town for a total of like 24 hours? And there''s 25 pictures, so pretty good. I don''t know why when I do something like this I shoot like it''s National Geographic back when they were decent. Walk and shoot, walk and shoot. Wait, look, shoot some more. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1539/0008.jpg)

Unlike those guys (almost to a person, guys, and if you want to see the seeds of their self-destruction, well, there''s one), I don''t have any patience or, as it turns out, time. Where they could sit on a single corner for days to wait for one shot, I move around probably too fast. Impatient, maybe, but also there''s so much to see, especially in a new place. This goes back to what I was saying about not slowing down and working a subject a [while back](https://matt.pictures/first_sunday_in_july). Knowing I only have a certain number of hours left in a day definitely plays a part.   

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1539/0023.jpg)

There''s also a little alarm bell, a little flag in my head that goes off when some things happen that says ''this is important! something is happening! take a lot of pictures of it!'' and for some reason the 20 minutes after takeoff and the 20 minutes before landing in an airplane are always flagged. Big landmarks, definitely flagged. Times Square in New York, I could photograph there for days (and have, I go basically every time I''m in NYC, it''s a sickness). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1539/0005.jpg)

Something I''m thinking about for San Pablo though. I started out with the thesis, handed to me on a silver platter by Robin, that it was the most interesting street in the Bay Area, more so than Market or Polk in SF or Telegraph in Oakland/Berkeley. But the place I''ve ended up is that any street (any place) _becomes_ interesting the more you look at it, and also it becomes harder and harder to pin down what you''re talking about. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1539/0015.jpg)


This town was cool though, not super touristy in the bad way, good vibes, nice light even at night. Nothing shouty, but nothing terrible either. Lots of hills.

Still in last yeah, just wanted to throw something up because I haven''t been posting. My quick collection overfloweth, and this starts to bring down the numbers. Also, I''m playing with [Robin''s new protocol](https://github.com/robinsloan/spring-83-spec/blob/main/draft-20220616.md). It''s interesting, but there are some rough edges. It doesn''t natively support images, and you might be thinking, Matt, why would you play with something that doesn''t support pictures? I''m working on getting that in, that''s why.

Went down to Embarcadero last night, just to check this out. I''ve rented a camera for the next week, a Fuji GFX 50sii, trying to figure out what''s next. It''s surprisingly good at what it does. Slow. Big. Bonkers high ISO performance though; some of these are at ISO10k and pushed three stops, and looks totally decent. 50 megapixels. Not sure I need ''em, but it sure is nice. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1436/002.jpg)

Unfortunately, it''s a little slow. Not as bad as the z7 I rented, although I''m becoming convinced that it was broken or configured badly in some way. Still, a little too slow for my tastes. Perfect for this kind of work, though. Mostly static, easy to lock focus on. We''re going to Yosemite later this week, which it''ll also be great for.

Finally getting to these (checks notes) about six months after I meant to. This was a killer party, lots of good food and music. I kind of wasn''t on my game that night? I''d gotten a bad haircut and had a weird day wandering around Minneapolis. It didn''t matter that much, there was also a real wedding photographer there, so I was able to mostly relax and enjoy. I think this was the trip I really started to notice my like, normal energy levels starting to flag also? Like normally I would have been going to the after party and staying out all night with everyone but I just couldn''t, this time.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1563/0002.jpg)

I have a shit ton of stuff in the backlog like this, just waiting to be posted (more than a year''s worth at this point). I also have _two_ book projects in full swing, both the San Pablo book and the [Big Empty](https://bigempty.photos/archive/) work. Need to get a bunch of it out the door soon, as I feel like a lot of things are just going to keep happening and it''s going to be all I can do to keep up. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1563/0003.jpg)

Love this kid''s energy. Just like, no rules, this is the best seat in the house right in the middle of the dance floor, and I''m gonna sit here and eat my dinner. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1563/0004.jpg)

 I also haven''t posted the really strange architecture from this trip, wandering around the city near my hotel the night before (maybe I''ll do those next? who knows). The big football stadium that resembled nothing so much as a crashed spaceship or an intrusion from a neighboring dimension. Anyway, I digress.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1563/0005.jpg)

The aunties and the uncles were also a riot. What a great crowd.

The first day we had to spend in florence, as opposed to just stopping to sleep there before rushing onward to Sardinia, was kind of a slow start. I was alone, because Sophie had caught some kind of bug and stayed in the hotel to rest. 7 days of raving was bound to catch up to us. I felt fine, so I went out walking. Brought her back some breakfast, and then continued on my way. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1459/0002.jpg)

I wandered around and took bad photos of narrow streets in deep shadow close to our bnb. Got myself some breakfast, coffee and a croissant in a little cafe that was arty and pretentious in a way they never seem to be here any more; local art on the walls, a few benches and simple concrete tables. Very good coffee, like everywhere that served espresso in Italy. I sat in the little cafe and tried to make a plan for the day, a plan which I mostly threw out the window.  The second cappuccino finally got my brain into gear and I was off, ready to actually move and groove. See the sights, take some photos. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1459/0003.jpg)

I started by walking towards the Duomo, ate a really good ham sandwich at a place down the street from the place everyone was in line for, and just generally wandered in that area for a bit. Lot of high end shops, expensive watches and jewelry, fashion houses that have an outpost in Florence, that sort of thing. I was not in a mood to shop, not particularly, but the people watching is always pretty good in these areas. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1459/0004.jpg)

Did I do anything else of note that day? Wandered, bought groceries, went back to our airbnb, which was right by the main train station. Sophie wasn''t feeling well still, and a test confirmed: it was COVID. There was a couch in our room, so I slept there and tried to isolate. I''d also gotten my bivalve booster a couple weeks before, so thought I might be safe. Turns out I was just a couple days behind her.

The long essay (about how long it takes to build something) is coming. It currently has that problem that a lot of my anecdotes have, in that it doesn''t have a neat ending. My friend Alex used to say, when I''d tell a story like that, that I should end it with ''then I found five dollars,'' so people a) know it''s over and b) think there was a point to my meandering. The point really is just the meandering, though, and nothing else. Once, I did find $5 in the street, and sent him a picture of it. I think I laughed about that for a whole day.', '2023-01-27 08:15:19', '2023-01-27 08:47:16', NULL, '2023-01-27 08:43:27', 1, false, NULL, false, '{first_day_in_florence}');

dang it''s been a long time. [PKE (Phixed Kings Expeditions)](https://www.instagram.com/phixedkingsexpeditions/) is cool but somehow I only make it out to one once every other year or so. buncha kids who get out of bed early on a saturday or sunday and go ride 60 or 70 (sometimes 100!) miles. This one was pretty flat but I still ended up dropping and getting to the end like half an hour after everyone. I''m moderately cursed, I''ve been to two or three of them but always the morning of I can''t find some important article of bike gear. This time it was my shoes. Rode clipless pedals in street shoes for like 65 miles. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1466/0002.jpg)

Like their name suggests, they''re mostly fixed gear riders, which I respect, but I can''t keep up on my fixie; this ride I think I had the gravel bike. The only reason I ride a gravel bike is I like squishy tires. This was a fun ride but by the end I could barely sit on my saddle. Somehow I''m always doing things I''m not in shape for. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1466/0001.jpg)

Anyway. Not a ton to say. Eighteen months ago? I''ll do something recent next, promise.

INSERT INTO public.posts (id, title, og_image, description, body, inserted_at, updated_at, slug, published_at, site_id, page_only, buy_link, is_retail, slugs) VALUES (1437, 'a good shoot', 'https://images.matt.pictures/1437/0003.jpg', 'a whole bunch of pictures', '# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1437/0001.jpg)

Sometimes, when I go out to shoot pictures, everything goes wrong. I start by forgetting I had the camera in self timer the last time I was shooting, so I miss the first picture. Then I get off a couple frames, and realize the ISO is also set to eleventy-million. Then the autofocus hunts when I’m trying to get a picture of something fleeting, like someone walking slowly through the frame; I realize the focus point has fucked off to the corner of the frame somehow. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1437/0002.jpg)

Once I get in a funk like this, it’s important to realize that nothing good can happen and I should just stop; but “can’t stop won’t stop forgot how to stop” isn’t just my twitter bio. Sometimes such a shoot can be redeemed by stopping, taking a break, perhaps a shot of whiskey, and moving on. A reset for the mind. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1437/0003.jpg)

W. Eugene Smith, when he was shooting in steel factories for Time Magazine (when Time meant something, that is), would stop in the middle of the damn place, have his assistant produce a portable record player, and sit and have a whiskey, if the shooting wasn’t going well. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1437/0004.jpg)

All that to say, sometimes, a shoot is the opposite. The camera is always ready; the light is at the right angle, and I’m on the right side of the street to use it. The modes are right, the autofocus does its job and gets out of the way. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1437/0005.jpg)

More than that, though. I’m seeing clearly and responding to what’s in front of me. When I compose, I remember to glance at the frame edges and think about what’s there, at least a little bit, to make sure I’m not cutting anything off accidentally (doing it on purpose is fine). I’m adjusting depth of field to fit the composition. There’s a kind of focus of intent that spreads out to all the different factors you have to manage to make a good picture; on the good days, it feels like I’m doing the one thing I was put here on earth for. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1437/0006.jpg)

Or maybe, sometimes, it feels like nothing. Last sunday, I had the good kind of session. I was just walking and found a groove. I wasn’t reviewing images as I shot, except to check exposure occasionally. I had a feeling I was doing pretty well, but years of shooting film (which was really two decades ago now, jeez I’m getting old) sort of burned out trying to guess if the pictures were good while the shoot is still happening. Sometimes there is a good vibe, though, that you don’t look too closely at, for fear of scaring it off.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1437/0007.jpg)

Then, you get home and you''ve shot 80 pictures, and 20 of them are good enough to blog. you know how wild that is? Normally a 5% hit rate (one or two per roll of 36, in the old days) was good. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1437/0008.jpg)

I don’t know that there’s a point to this, other than to mark how wonderful it is when it happens. I don’t have any secrets for accessing this higher plateau of art making. It’s mostly a matter of doing the thing and being there when the time comes. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1437/0009.jpg)

Photography (and painting, and sculpture) is a business of millimeters and milliseconds. Writing probably too, especially poetry (“[For he''s the super realist](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52319/constantly-risking-absurdity-15)…”) Either you’re at the right place at the right time or you’re not. The margin for error is brutally small, and the photo, in the end, is binary: either it works or it doesn’t. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1437/0010.jpg)

On the best days, I am a gambler with loaded dice. All the chance elements turn my way, and I come by at just the right moment, with the right lens on, and make the pictures.

These were from some months ago, driving out through the delta and across the central valley. The Driftwood spring retreat was out in the foothills, in a spot that was pretty ideal for a dozen or so people to descend and party it up. But first we had to get there. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1554/0002.jpg)

Someone once told me the framing in the title, that California''s central valley wasn''t a collection of farms but a factory for turning the water from the sierrra snowpack into food. As we drove through it this time it was hard not to see it that way, as a vast organism of production. Incredible amounts of labor shape and reshape the landscape. Even the delta we started the trip in is a collection of man made dikes and islands.

Anyway. I should mention here that if you like this sort of thing, Matt does a travellogue, I''m going to be taking a trip later this year, in September, and sending out a pop-up newsletter to go with it. https://bigempty.photos/ if you''d like to sign up for that; the first issue in the archive has a little more background.

I just felt like posting something, and scrolled through the stuff in my backlog (which I keep in Lightroom''s ''Quick Collection''). This was the first set that really kind of hung together. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1441/0002.jpg)

This was last year, about this time (roughly August). I had just gotten fired from my job, and decided I should take some time off, and as it happened Christa was visiting, so it kinda worked out. We met and took the ferry to Oakland, probably got dinner, or I drove her to Allie''s? I don''t remember, she might''ve stayed with us for part of it too. Next day, we went to the Bay Model (not pictured, talk about drab lighting inside but fascinating to look at). Then an afternoon walking around the de Young with Allie, dinner in the Sunset, Uke on the couch, and a hike on the last day. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1441/0003.jpg)

Some or all of that may be out of order, it was a long time ago. I''m pretty sure Christa has visited twice since then? or maybe I was in NYC twice and she was here once? Anyway, there are a lot more photos on the backlog. A whole years worth, almost.  Remember when I did short posts, just one or two photos? Yeah, me neither.

Akhil does these pretty regularly; because of weird blog time dilation, this one is getting posted a month after the last one, but the parties themselves were more like 6 months apart. This one was a little more low-key; I knew maybe half the people, and we rode bikes to get there because it''s mad close. Close enough that when I realized I''d forgotten my cigar at home, I went back to get it. I showed three pictures; one from amsterdam (I know, I''ll start blogging those next) and two from running around shooting with the z8. I just really liked that camera.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1518/0002.jpg)

I used the Z8 with a leica M mount adapter to shoot all of these; it did really well in pretty tricky lighting. Nothing is perfect (and no digital camera will ever have the highlight detail of color negative film, unfortunately), but this is great. The manual focus lenses also performed pretty well; I was worried the screen wouldn''t have the resolution to really nail focus, but all of this was wide open, and all of these are what I would call ''acceptable''. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1518/0011.jpg)

Which brings me to the big reveal, and why I''m publishing these now instead of something else: I don''t think I''m gonna be a Leica guy any more. On the internet, we joke about types of guys, there''s a wife guy, there''s the flashlight guy, and in photography circles, there''s the ''leica man''. He drinks the finest coffees, he has only the best glass. Does he take photographs? Probably not! Can you tell I''ve never really liked that association? Love the cameras, hate the baggage that comes with them. Well. Sometimes love the cameras. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1518/0004.jpg)

The M11, I was cautiously optimistic at first, but the slow to turn on thing just reminds me every time I pick it up that it''s not really up to snuff. I''m a quick draw artist, gotta get the picture _now_. if it''s on and ready it''s pretty capable, but I think I need some time away from it, because it''s not ready too much of the time. Hopefully Leica will address the boot time with a firmware update and I can come back to it, or maybe they''ll have a -p model that doesn''t have the silly always-open shutter. Maybe both! Who knows. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1518/0005.jpg)

Anyway, good party. There were a couple musical acts, a couple short films. Very chill. I think there was a reading of some description that I didn''t get because I was outside smoking. My fault, sounded like a good story from where I was.

these are from last year, possibly the first time I came down to Santa Barbara for work, but maybe the second time. Not really sure. A bunch of the team came in at the same time so we could all meet each other and work in the same room for a bit. Coincidentally, I''m in SB right now for the same reason, 13 months later. I dragged my personal laptop down here just so I could blog while I was away from home. That''s not true I also brought it for Netflix. Anyway.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1509/0006.jpg)

Had a thought today, as I was in the plane while we descended over the pacific. The approach to SBA is partly over water, and affords really nice views of the shore backed up by mountains. There was a perfect distance where the sky and the land and the sea were all even, and the photo naturally worked. The whole flight was one of those where the photos just jumped at me, so look out for those some time soon. Or later. Because the right distance is important.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1509/0007.jpg)

When I''m taking a photo, I have to visualize, that is, kind of imagine what it''ll look like as a finished image. It''s mostly emotional, a response to the potential of the scene. It''s also something I have to be careful with, because the emotions I feel, as a person taking a picture, can be out of joint with the situation, but that''s another essay. So I take pictures by feeling.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1509/0009.jpg)

And anyway, I also edit by feeling, at least at first. What makes it into the first broad set of selects is a simple ''yes''. I take that and then refine it later. This set of pictures started out as 60, and you see here 12. So it''s not a small amount of work to decide what goes into any given post. This is where proper distance comes in.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1509/0010.jpg)

As I''m editing, it''s important to see what''s in the picture, not what I wanted to see when I was taking it. It''s best if I can''t remember the previsualization at all. That way I can select the photos based on what works. BUT. If I try to do this too soon after a shoot, it''s a lot harder to let go of the things that I thought would be really good while shooting. It''s a kind of attachment that is hard to let go of. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1509/0011.jpg)

In professional circles, they have the luxury of another person to do the photo editing. Sometimes several people. Photographer takes the pictures, sends in everything (or maybe a set of selects, I''ve never really worked with a photo editor). The editor can then assemble the photos into a story. They can do this quickly, because they''re not burdened with the emotions from shooting. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1509/0012.jpg)

Me though, I work alone. Mostly because I don''t want to pay someone to edit my photos; the perspective of a good photo editor, just like an editor for writing, is invaluable. I''m about to start on a new project, and I might see about finding an editor to work with for it. Might be better for it.

These pick up right where the pictures from yesterday left off. I had just walked by the guy in the bear suit playing bass, it was our second day in town and we were just walking around the tourist area near the Ponte Louis I, the arch bridge in a couple of these pictures. Lots of locals hanging around too, although it was obviously a destination and not as much a place people live. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1558/0002.jpg)

The top of the bridge was maybe 100m longer than the bottom, and connected higher elevations of each side. The hills of Porto were steep enough around the river that there were stairs and a funicular that I didn''t get to ride (too crowded, didn''t want COVID). But the bridge was nice, top and bottom. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1558/0003.jpg)

Went across, dodging the bright yellow trams, and took a cable car ride down to the side of the river. Nice way to see the city, good views all around. When we got to the end, we went to a little food hall, where there was a Brazilian spot serving Pao de quejio, brazilian cheese bread. It''s so good, and so cheesy.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1558/0004.jpg)

I think after that we looked around at a bunch of little stalls in a street market that was set up, nothing I really wanted to buy though, so I didn''t. Took the tram back up the hill, walked back across to the Porto side of the river; at least according to the map, Porto is on the north side, and it''s another town on the other side. Our rental was up the hill a bit, just around the corner from some spectacular views. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1558/0005.jpg)

We did end up taking kind of the long way home, wandering up into town, past some more modern shops and cafes. It''s a nice town, Porto. A bunch of people have said it''s similar to SF, in that both are tourist destinations, both are very hilly, both are on the west coast and enjoy a mediterranean climate. It’s also actually several cities bisected by a body of water, the bay here and the River Douro there. Neither is the biggest city on their respective coasts, both have a larger city to the south that starts with L (LA/Lisbon). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1558/0006.jpg)

I think that''s where the similarities end, though? Porto is a very different geography really, away from the river it''s a plateau. The architecture couldn''t be more different; the building we stayed in was older than California. They speak Portugese, and when I tried to speak it, I think there was some confusion because I speak the Brazilian form and not theirs. Tons of walking, just way more than is possible in any city in the US save like, New York.

Good city though. Plenty of good wine, coffee and food. I''ve got one more set of photos and then it''s on to the next thing that happened. I have no idea what that is now, but I will soon.

went to this show tuesday night, and oh my god skating polly has gotten a lot better since the last time I saw them, way back in 2012. I remember then thinking “These kids really rock, not just for 12 year olds or whatever,” and now they’ve grown and refined their sound a crapton. Wild and energetic and angry and everything I want in a punk band. I should note that this could have been a lot more photos; it was espcially hard to edit these for some reason.

Go Team was new to me, but just a lot of fun, in a nice unironic way. Good stage presence from all the members, a lot going on. Audience participation (I got to yell my star sign into a mic, and it was being filmed and when I realized that moment will probably be on the internet forever I almost spontaneously combusted on the spot).

These are black and white because color in clubs is bullshit. Most of these just don’t work as color; the meter on the little camera I had couldn’t keep up or something. Black and white is better anyway.

So we set out from James and Janelle''s, heading due west on back roads. Pretty quickly we were in the middle of nowhere, practically. North of Petaluma and west of 101 is ranch and wine country. Lots of big hills that don''t quite make mountains. We got to the 1 at Tomales, and followed it south. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1444/0002.jpg)

There are a half dozen little towns you pass through on the way down the eastern side of Tomales Bay; little places that may have once subsisted on fishing industry, but now seem to exist mostly for people to visit. That''s not a bad thing; it''s a gem of a little bay, and the rolling hills make for an excellent drive, even on the sunday of a big holiday weekend. The traffic wasn''t bad, but there were a lot of tourists hitting the open restaurants. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1444/0003.jpg)

For no particular reason (OK, a very peculiar one unrelated to anything here), I''ve been thinking about dowsing the last couple of days. You know, the thing where someone gets a forked stick, or sometimes two bent wires, and they walk around and find where to dig for a well. You might be thinking, "Surely that must be fake, and there''s no way hard-headed Matt believes in such nonsense," but you''d be wrong. You see, I have the knack for dowsing myself. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1444/0004.jpg)

I don''t remember how it started. I think we''d seen some show on the history channel about it, and the person in the show had used bent wires, L shaped, one in each hand, with the long part of the L being maybe 18" and sticking out in front. My dad said, yeah, some folk have the knack and some don''t. Your Great Uncle Shorty, (or some other relative, I don''t recall) he could dowse." Well, one of us realized we had a surplus of wire coat hangers and pliers. 
 
# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1444/0005.jpg)

Next thing we knew, all three of us were out in the back yard pacing around. The first time the wires crossed in my hand ( and every time after, too) it felt as though some force was pushing on them, and there was no way for me to stop them. We had well water, despite living in a house in the middle of a suburb of 35,000; the house predated the development of the area by a few years. The wires would always cross when I walked over where the pipes fed from the wellhouse to the house proper. Eyes closed, eyes open. Weird, inexplicable, not terribly useful skill, in the days of ground penetrating radar and sonar and whatnot. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1444/0006.jpg)

I tell that story because it feels a little bit like the process of making pictures for me. Like there''s this inexplicable force between me and the image. Sometimes I go out with my camera (bend coat hanger rods) and look for the pictures (the water) and can''t find it, other times it''s there and I can''t stop it. There are a lot of easy explanations that flatten an essentially inexplicable experience; if you try to examine it too closely it disappears.  

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1444/0007.jpg)

I''ve talked [recently](https://matt.pictures/post/a_good_shoot) about good days shooting, and this is kind of like that. I think what I was talking about in that post was a kind of mastery, of getting the thing right. A dowser day, a day like this sunday afternoon, is more like something rolling down the hill. It''s a thing that happens as a side effect of pointing the camera at stuff and pushing the button. "In the moment of aiming, the [camera] turns like a dowser''s wand" (to steal a paraphrase from Tom Waits) and even though it feels like you haven''t done anything, the pictures happen. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1444/0008.jpg)

OK, enough blather. I probably should have tried for a tighter edit; maybe one less boat? I had so many of that long beach that I cut, and other images of pretty much everything you see here. This edit started out at like 40 pictures. Anyway. Next: Matt goes to Europe and reviews a camera (maybe).

This is just another quick one. The surprise was last September, so no danger in spoiling it for anyone that should know. I, on the other hand, should know better than to sit on photos for (checks notes) seven months.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1574/0002.jpg)

I do love this like genuine surprise on both of their faces... I think Kawan was surprised he actually pulled off the surprise party. Helen, the one who was surprised, is just shocked to see all of us after the hike they''d been on. Just a moment of pure joy. Anyway.

Most of september, I lived out of my suitcase. Labor day weekend, I was flying back from Denver. I had been there at a conference, technically in Aurora. The night before had been a late one; there was an open bar that had Laphoriag, and it only takes a couple (three?) these days to give me a wicked hangover. But that''s not what this is about, nor is it about the 3am Mcd''s I may have had. I managed to get up in the morning and get myself together, get to the airport. By the time I got through security, I''d drank a liter of water and one of gatorade, and I was feeling somewhat human. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1443/00003.jpg)

Of course, that meant that as soon as we got to cruising altitude, I was asleep. Turns out that was a good thing, lots of clouds over the Rockies, not a ton to see. I woke up as we were passing over the eastern sierra, snapped a pic of the fires over Yosemite, and tried to wake up to march through the airport. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1443/00004.jpg)

Somehow, I either took a wrong turn or something, but my plane went to terminal 1, and I ended up walking all the way to the exit in Terminal 2. Maybe I was still a bit hungover. At least I only had carry-on luggage; I walked out the door and Sophie pulled up about two minutes later, and we were off. I had kinda thought I''d go home, maybe take a shower and grab some clean clothes, but things were already in motion, and there wasn''t time. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1443/00005.jpg)

Sophie drove straight from the airport north, across the bridge and onto the 101. I don''t remember the town name, but we were headed somewhere in Marin, where our friends James and Janelle have a place with a pool. Cason and Ryan were already there, having a good time and texting us, telling us to hurry.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1443/0001.jpg)

I feel like I got there, cracked a beer, and hopped in the pool, but there was probably more to it than that. They definitely showed us around the place. It was dark, when we got there, but it was also still like 80º. This was one of the last really hot weekends, so the water was fine. I was able to run laundry, shower, and fall asleep in a nice warm bed.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1443/0002.jpg)

Sunday, we went to the grocery store and got some essentials, burgers and chips and that sort of thing. Just sort of had a lazy day most of the morning, besides the grocery run. James grilled the burgers for a late lunch, just a perfect Labor Day weekend. Then, I''d decided ahead of time that I wanted to go shoot pictures around sunset in Point Reyes, because it was my birthday weekend. So we took the car and headed west, in that direction. But those photos will be in the next post.

This was summer 2021, after everyone got vaccinated but before Delta came and took away our hopes and dreams. Drink and Draw is a little get together for creative folks to be creative in an easygoing space. I haven''t been in a while, but the format is probably the same now; they''re announced on insta [@drinkndraw.elis](https://www.instagram.com/drinkndraw.elis/).

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1445/0002.jpg)

Anyway, at the start, everybody throws out a prompt, and someone makes a list of all of them. Then you just sit there and chat and draw the prompts and have drinks and food and sometimes there''s a dog. I''m a terrible draw-er but it''s still fun to see what people come up with, to figure out interesting ways to interpret the prompts, and just have fun being creative with folks. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1445/0003.jpg)

Pausing on the recent for a little bit while I live with the next photos off the queue from my month-ish of travel. It''s nice to get a little distance from the photos. At least, that''s what I tell myself to justify a year+ of backlog that I haven''t posted. Also, I feel like the next post is going to be somewhat camera-reviewy, which makes me cringe reading it back to myself. but I spent a long time agonizing over this new camera, and really ended up liking it, and I think there are things about it not covered in the endless algorithm optimized reviews that are already out there. So, a review.

I''ve been sitting on this edit since sardinia, trying to get it into a shape that works as a single post, but really, I was in Amsterdam for a week, a lot happened, and also I''m a little bit letting myself try to make a perfect post rather than just post already, nobody cares if every post isn''t perfect. It''s just a blog. So it''s gonna be four-ish posts, unless someone complains, in which case I''ll post every photo individually, out of spite.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1525/0002.jpg)

Also, and this is true, I usually have a couple tabs open in my browser with this here blog up, just to remind me while I''m flipping through tabs that it would be good to pay some attention to this space, usually in the form of a new post. But for the last few weeks, at least since I got back from Italy/Portugal (that''s gonna be a lot of posts), I haven''t had the page open at all. So my ADHD ass hasn''t had the reminder to keep it real here.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1525/0003.jpg)

Anyway, Amsterdam: hell of a town. I worked all day monday and tuesday, and then hopped on a direct flight. I arrived some time in the... morning? I think? and took the train into the center of town. I love when names of things are obviously a linguistic use-path; the central train station and transit hub is known simply as "Centraal." Beautiful train station I immediately failed to exit, because I didn''t see the ticket machines at the airport and just got on the train. I was already jet-lagged. I managed to buy a ticket on my phone and get out, and the hotel I was crashing at was just across a canal, next to another canal. I know, I just described half the city (the other half being at the intersection of two or more canals). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1525/0004.jpg)

The whole reason for this trip was Sophie was there for work, so the hotel was paid for and rather nice; it was chosen for its proximity to the office she was commuting to, but that also put it right on the edge of the Red Light district, which was... certainly something. I mean, just very gross before about 10am, when the street cleaners would come through. The thing is, it''s not just the girls in the windows, it''s a huge concentration of tourist bars and shops and the like. Like the French Quarter in New Orleans, or sixth street in Austin, maybe. I mean, there''s also the coffeeshops which don''t sell coffee (they''re for weed and mushrooms), but weed and ''shrooms are practically part of a balanced diet next to the amount of binge drinking that had to be happening.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1525/0005.jpg)

But anyway, back to my reasons for the trip. I really just wanted to get a feel for the city, hit one or two big museums, and that was about it. It doesn''t take much to get me on a plane. I walked around a bunch and took pictures. Tried and failed to find cuban cigars. I worked from the room and also the lobby of the hotel, where they had an excellent espresso machine. That and melatonin and my jet lag was gone in record time.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1525/0006.jpg)

In _Ted Lasso_, the episode where they go play a match in Amsterdam, the character Roy Kent complains that the whole city feels a little fake, like it''s a set for a movie or something. And I kind of understand that feeling; something about the sameness of the buildings, and the improbable angles they tilt at just gives the whole place a sheen of unreality. It didn''t help that I was staying in the most touristy spot in like all of Europe, either. I''m sure there''s some historical reason the buildings are all the same brick, just like there''s a reason all the houses in Santa Fe have to be the same color (one of five, I think). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1525/0007.jpg)

There might''ve been a point to all that, but I''m not sure. The giant fish head mosaic would probably agree.

So, after Point Reyes and my birthday on Tuesday, I basically did laundry and started packing again, this time for two weeks away in Italy. A for-real vacation for the first time in a while. Two years? Maybe three? 2020 we went to Colorado in the fall, but that was a working trip, where we were just isolated somewhere else and doing our jobs remotely. I don''t recall a vacation in 2021. NYC in 2019 might be the last one? Anyway. New camera came wednesday of that week, and I have some thoughts, which I''m gonna share at a later date. It came on the trip. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1446/0002.jpg)

We went to the airport mid-afternoon, for a 7something departure, SFO to Frankfurt, and then Frankfurt to Florence, where we were stopping overnight. I''m sure Frankfurt is a lovely town, but Florence is a short train ride from Rome, and for some reason the tickets were cheaper (and our hotel, too). It made a sort of sense when we were planning, anyway. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1446/0003.jpg)

I really do love the international terminal''s departures hall. Just a big airy space. People going somewhere, people coming from somewhere. Also, I never knew that SFO has an out-of-doors patio at the far end of the G terminal, but it was right by our gate, so we took the opportunity to get a couple last breaths of fresh air and sunlight. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1446/0004.jpg)

Anyway, we boarded and were delayed, but finally took off. I sat there, reading for quite a while, and then I looked out the window and noticed some odd lights: it took me a moment to realize, in my sleep-deprived state, that it was the Aurora. I''d never seen it in person before. Of course, I only had the tiny camera, and didn''t yet know how to lock it to infinity, so the resulting pictures are even blurrier than they would be normally. Still, it''s something. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1446/0005.jpg)

Arrived in Frankfurt, got our passports stamped for entry into the EU, and ran for our flight to Florence, only to see that it too was delayed, and then it was delayed again. Finally, we boarded, flew another hour, and landed at sunset in Florence (beautiful, but through a dirty window; the pictures look like they were taken with vaseline on the lens). Wandered out to find the Taxi stand and the queue, waited another 30 minutes, and got to our hotel just in time to get dinner. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1446/0006.jpg)

Then the next day, we had breakfast and set off for a day in Rome. Next time!

think this was when I was between jobs one of several times. There''s a part of me that wants to abandon all these really old photos, declare a sort of backlog bankruptcy and have a clean slate. Then there''s a bloody minded part of me that says post every photo. Both of those voices, if they were those cartoon embodied conscious, would be devils, one on each shoulder. I know how I got to a place where my backlog was almost two years long (2021 was a real bastard) but I don''t think there''s anything for it but to keep posting. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1460/0002.jpg)

Edit to add: I remembered the occasion for these photos. It was the first day the cable cars reopened in San Francisco, and I was off, so I decided to go and do a slightly touristy thing while I had time. They''re a fully ridiculous way to travel, but at the same time fairly enjoyable. Better than walking up those steep hills.

Woke up early-ish in our hotel in Florence, had what was probably the best breakfast of the trip (they had a pancake machine and real maple syrup), and took a city bus down to the Florence train station, Santa Maria Novella. We purchased tickets from a nice lady and had just enough time to grab some food before our train left for Rome. I want to say it was about two hours on the train, just sort of sinking into our jetlag and exhaustion. It was going to be a long day.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1447/0002.jpg)

The first thing we did was stash our larger bags. Sophie and I both had packed relatively light for two weeks away from home, just a carry on and personal item (camera bag for me, backpack for her). But lugging even that much luggage around the city seemed like a real pain, and there are plenty of luggage storage spots that''ll hang onto your bags for a small fee right by the train station. Once that was stashed, we set off walking.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1447/0003.jpg)

The original plan was to walk quite a long way, to try to stay awake as long as possible. We sat down at a cafe in Rome and got some espressos, and immediately felt tired. The coffee picture was taken at 6am California time, or about 2pm in rome. Our flight out of Fiumicino was later, like 8pm, so we had time to see a few things. We ventured inside a church that had us go through a metal detector that didn''t care at all about my cameras; I was hauling the whole kit, since I didn''t want to leave the real valuables in a luggage storage spot of unknown provenance. They didn''t seem to care or even want to look in my bag when it made the thing beep. I must''ve looked pretty harmless or very jet lagged or both.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1447/0004.jpg)

Inside the church, there were a lot of incredible works of art, just amazing, and not a ton of light. This wasn''t one of the big main churches, just one that was sort of in our path. There is an unbelievable amount of wealth in rome, just centuries of the church paying for people to make cool shit and then gild it with gold from faraway lands.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1447/0005.jpg)

After the church, we walked another 20ish minutes, slowly, to the Colosseum. It''s possible we could''ve ridden the metro and been there in just a few minutes, but remember, time to kill (on checking, now, I think the metro station may have been under construction? hard to say for sure). So we walked through a pretty scruffy park and there were other ruins, less famous, fenced off there. It came into view from kind of the top of a hill. Lots of tourists, huge line to get it, so we decided, at least for this trip, to just walk around. It was super hot anyway.   

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1447/0006.jpg)

Walking around, about 3/4 of the way, both myself and Sophie hit a wall, and just sat in the shade for a minute drinking water. Deciding that discretion is the better part of valor and majority rules, we hopped a taxi back to the train station. The taxi driver dropped us off a couple blocks from the station because from the direction of the Colosseum the traffic was kind of impossible. Which turned out to be a stroke of luck, because we sat down at the first pasta joint we saw and ordered what looked good, plus a beer for me and a wine for Sophie, just for safety. And the food was really good, like pretty much every other meal we had while we were in Italy. Seriously, they export their tomatoes, but they keep the best stuff for domestic consumption. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1447/0007.jpg)

Then, back into the train station, tickets on the Leonardo Express to Fiumicino. I think we both dozed a bit on the train, and then while we were in the airport, I lost my hat shuffling things in my bag. We bought a bottle of champs in the terminal so we’d have something for breakfast, and I had to put it in my bigger bag, which had my hat; after that point, the hat was not seen. RIP cubs hat with the neon logo. Anyway, our flight was on time for a change, so we left Rome at around 9 and landed in Olbia around 10. Someone Sophie knew on from the festival group on Facebook gave us a ride from there to San Teodoro, where the festival was held. Finally got to our airbnb around 11 and crashed pretty hard.

Our dishwasher has been somewhat busted for a couple months, not heating up to do the sanitize and dry parts of the cycle. A tech came out and plugged in a gadget and said it needed a new mainboard and a new heating element, and we have a waranty, so it was free, but parts are backlogged, so it was 7 weeks, and in the interim, I was like, I can get the parts on ebay and swap em and see if that fixes it. It didn''t, and I thought, oh, ebay parts, must be, so when they came and replaced them, and it still didn''t work, and I tried to resign myself to just not having a dishwasher that sanitized my dishes. 

Anyway, a couple days ago I''m in the shower and I think, what haven''t we replaced? and I realized there has to be some kind of temperature sensor. I dig through the parts diagram and can''t find a sensor, and there''s no shop manual, but I find an article describing where it might be. So I yank it out from under the cabinet again, and feel around and find what looks like a sensor hooked up to one of the wiring harnesses, and it''s not working like it should from what I can tell with the multimeter. So I go and search that component, and I see it''s a ''manual reset thermostat''. The bit poking out of the back, I push, and it clicks, makes a little noise I mean, and so I test it, and now it''s zero ohms instead of no connection. 

Button everything back up, get the dishwasher put back under the counter, and run it with what was already in there, and it works. Dry, sanitized dishes.

The moral: if your dishwasher isn''t heating up, and you''re fixing it yourself, check to see if you have a manual reset thermostat (you''ll have to find it and look for the button on the back) first, and make sure it''s working.

These two nights weren''t one after the other, they were instead a couple weeks apart, but the pictures were right next to each other in my editor, and they sort of fit together, I think. Mid-October, these. Both nights I only had the ricoh, the dance club because I was afraid they had a policy on interchangeable lens cameras, and the church photos because I was just walking to the store. 


# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1467/0004.jpg)

I haven''t quite run out of super epic awesome pictures in the backlog, but I think there''s a whole lot more like this coming. I probably will have a whole dang book of photos of ''just walking to the store'' or ''just popping out for lunch''.

Then again, I''m going to Mexico City in a couple days, so I''ll probably get some good stuff there. Mexico is always great.

These have been awaiting final edits and posting for (counts)... 16 months, more or less. Taken two calendar years ago, when we went to visit Sophie''s family in Santa Fe. Good trip. I remember running around the neighborhood to get the photos of the mountains at sunset two days in a row.

I''m working on getting prepared for the trip to Armenia. Made a gear list that I''ll probably cut down (one system? two? gear doubt is self-doubt projected on objects). Really I need two or three lenses; a wide, normal, and a short tele. On the moto trip I used mostly the 24-70. But since I''m doing portraits I really want the 105/1.4, and I don''t want to not bring the Leica. The 21 and the 35 for environmental portraits, and maybe the noctilux? I don''t know. I mean, I know what I use and I know what works well, I should just take that (meaning the summilux 50). The ''what ifs?'' will drive me nuts otherwise. So probably the Summilux.

So, first off, my use case isn’t the typical GR3 user. There are lots of people out there reviewing it as a street photography camera, a discrete shooter, and things of this nature, and I feel like the subject has been beaten to death. While I do some work that could sort of be called ‘street’, it’s more in the genre of walks with a camera, and I live where that happens in the street. I’ve discovered lately that I have no interest in not being seen.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1449/0002.jpg)

My perspective on the camera, then, is how well it works as a camera to take with me when I don’t want to drag the whole bag along. I’ve tried a number of these cameras in the past (most recently the Sony RX100 IV) and usually I end up between somewhat and very disappointed in them. I keep coming back though, because those pro bodies I like, the Leicas and Nikons, are fucking heavy. Also, a secondary use of the camera is to take into environments where $10k of kit probably shouldn’t, like the beach, and places it can’t, like clubs that don’t allow interchangeable lens cameras. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1449/0003.jpg)

Things I was excited about getting the camera: The 40mm (equivalent) focal length is probably my favorite? It can look like what you need it to, basically, although if what you need is a 200mm tele, you’re out of luck. I never have anything longer than 120 on me unless I know I’m going after birds (which is rare, because I hate schlepping an extra 5kg of lens). Also, it’s the same focal length as two other compacts I love: the Rollei 35 T and the Minolta CLE (the CLE can use any M lens, but I only ever use it with a 40mm). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1449/0004.jpg)

Other than that? I was hopeful that it would ‘click’, but there are a couple areas I was worried about: 

* Focus: I needn’t have worried about this one. It has several modes, and in decent to fair light (down to a comfortably lit interior, let’s say) it’s plenty snappy. There was a bit of a learning curve, and I feel like learning the different modes is a good use of your time with this camera. 
* Depth: At f/2.8, I didn’t know if I would be able to have a narrow enough plane of focus for my taste. I think it works, but I’d be happier with f/2. Pretty please, Ricoh?
* Startup time: This is often a pain with small cameras. Not so with the Ricoh. It’s faster to go from off to taking a picture than my M10-P. (Slower than the champ, my Nikon D750).
* Shutter lag: it’s as near to instant as I can tell with my various Mark 1 senses. I didn’t use it for any super fast action (no race cars, no sportsing), but I think it’d be fine for that, if you can get close enough.
* Battery life: people online will tell you 200 shots on a battery as if that’s small. For this kind of camera, it’s perfect, and a spare battery will fit in any pocket. Also, I feel like I got more than that from a battery, but they are brand new still.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1449/0005.jpg)

It does the thing; I could tell within about half an hour of shooting with it that it was going to work for me. Along the way I hit a couple bumps, though. I didn’t know how to engage manual focus when I was shooting the Aurora from our transatlantic flight, so all those pictures are blurry. It took me a little bit to figure out how to adjust shutter and aperture in manual mode. Other than that? It’s a good little camera. I was reminded, working with it, of the sensation of shooting with my F5 when it was new. Just a clean, well thought out instrument that does the job it’s made for. No excuses, no compromises for size (except not having a viewfinder).

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1449/0006.jpg)

One last note, on pocketability: It does fit into a pants pocket. HOWEVER, it’s pretty noticeable. Is that a camera in your pocket or do you need to see a doctor? Goes better in a small bag or jacket pocket; I carried mine, for most of the trip, in a small sling, along with my kindle, a couple spare batteries, sunglasses, money, phone, maybe some bug spray? And kept my pockets empty, so I didn’t have to remember to take stuff out when I was going in the ocean. Beaches, man.

It took me a while to ''find a way in'' visually, during the festival. I wasn''t there trying super hard the whole time, but it took 3 or 4 days to get to a place where I felt like I was capturing some of the real frenetic energy of the music and the dancing with my photos. I was stuck on the idea that I could somehow do it just with composition and subject, but of course there''s also light and time and timing. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1450/0002.jpg)

Even after the workshop in July, that was mostly about blur (and I need to post some of those photos and talk about it, there were some real revelations there), it still took me a while to relax and just do the thing that was in front of me. Letting go of what I think the picture _should_ be in a technical sense (well exposed, focused, sharp), and making pictures with some emotional content. After noodling about it for the last four months, I''m no longer sure the only emotion in a picture is in the blurry parts, as the workshop had it, but it''s a very powerful tool.

So, I have a problem. Last year, I posted on this here blog 25 times. At the same time, I basically stopped posting elsewhere; my instagram feed hasn''t had a new post (as opposed to a story that dissappears in 24 hours) in 9 months. Twitter is dead to me, and has been since the space grifter tendered his offer. My last post is a meme that says "JUST WALK OUT" and "[REAL WINNERS QUIT](https://www.instagram.com/p/CinsWk8uIdz/)". Other people''s servers seem like a dead end. But the problem is I really want to share more pictures with the world. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1451/0002.jpg)

It''s like this: I take a lot of photos. Almost every day, certainly every time I leave the house, I take a camera with me, and photos happen. Sometimes there are people in them, sometimes not. I do this because I am compelled to, not for any other reason. I''ve done it for so long now that I''m a bit lost when I forget and leave my camera at home. Some of the people in the photos are people I care about, sometimes they''re just people I come across, but either way, I think there''s some responsibility built into the act of making a photograph, at least for me. Gotta share that shit. At least the good ones.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1451/0003.jpg)

AND. And, I have a huge backlog, more than 18 months at this point. I''ve posted on this here blog 25 times this year, and the pile keeps growing growing and growing. I don''t think I can manage to post every day, but I think that''s OK because I don''t do something worth sharing every day. [Rusty](https://www.todayintabs.com/) does his newsletter four times a week, and it''s his full time job. I''m not comparing my work to his (see the [preview image](https://images.matt.pictures/1451/Screenshot 2022-12-22 at 02.29.58.jpg) and old friend li''s [practice guide](https://practice-guide.glitch.me/)), but I feel like setting expectations at less than a full time job seems reasonable. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1451/0004.jpg)

So: next year, two posts a week. Monday? Thursday? Who knows? will there be long essays? Just photos? photos with captions? I haven''t decided! Will it count if I just put up a [picture of a crab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation)? No! but almost everything else would. I might even do single image posts. A picture, a caption, BOOM, that''s half the week. 
Maybe I''ll get really spicy and add comments. Remember blog comments? Sometimes they were great! They never were on my blog, but maybe this time.

Trying to avoid the cliches here. There are so. many. But also, it''s an incredibly beautiful place. These were all with the rented rig, a GFX 50sii. Incredible dynamic range. 8 or ten stops into the shadows still has details. Anyway. enough camera faffing. Photos!

something like october 2021? I know, I know. I was looking through my collections in Lightroom and realized I may not have ever published these? I wish I had an image search that was just for stuff I''ve published here. Anyway. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1533/0002.jpg)

This trip was a weird low point for me; I''m pretty sure I''d started at [REDACTED] and kinda hated my life. I had a gout flare while we were there, which didn''t help anything. I think I was still on a lower dose of the Allopurinol. So I probably had the kind of shame spiral about the photos from this trip that I did about other things, just had a lot of bad feelings around them and never got to giving them a proper edit. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1533/0003.jpg)

These are all my in-laws, the Lewis clan. A fun bunch. Even though it was rainy, we had a good time; sat around and played card games, walked to the ocean, all that. Went for a drive before the gout set in, that''s where all the moody seashore pictures are from. I think I tripped and fell at one point, and that was what set off the flare. I don''t remember but I might''ve spent a whole day of the trip in bed? That sounds crazy but it is the kind of thing I did when I was having flare ups often. Haven''t had one in quite a while, fingers crossed.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1533/0004.jpg)

Even with that, it was still a nice trip. Nice airbnb, good company, good food. Had to be wheeled through the terminal on the way home, but I did buy another Pendleton cardigan (turns out they''re made in china now, unfortunately). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1533/0005.jpg)

This may be too many pictures of a brooding coastline, but I didn''t have time or energy to pick between what''s here. This is only half of what was in the looser edit, at least.

and then sometimes on the last night of a week of partying, something magic happens. We met up with some folks from home-ish that Sophie had met out at a show in San Francisco. They invited us back to theirs for a little more party.

We were walking up the hill away from the club as the sun was coming up. Their rental pad was close, and we came in and chilled for a while.

These are in vibes order, again. Lot of verticality in this edit. Had a really nice time the weekend these were taken, stayed at Hunter and Jason''s place. Great view out of their windows, pity there wasn''t a decent photographer there to get a shot of it.

Anyway. Had a real nice portfolio review earlier this week, looking at the san pablo work, working on mashing it into a shape to start shopping it around as a book and maybe an exhibition. Sets that work together, colors, leitmotifs. I''ll have to make some prints, too, if there''s a show. Gallery show? Me? Maybe. Have to find a gallery.

Farmed out the work prints earlier today, anyway. Going to be an interesting exercise to see if I can make it work.

I might be a little bit nuts. Last week, I went on a trip, my favorite kind of trip. Fly to Albuquerque, get picked up, ride to santa fe, sleep six hours, pick up a rental car, drive to oklahoma. Sleep 7 hours, hang out with my Dad for the first time in a year. Hang out with my friend KJ, also first time in at least a year. Sleep four hours. Drive to texas, stop in a rest area and sleep half an hour. Drive the rest of the way back to Santa Fe, arriving after the rental car place closes. Go sleep for 8 hours, return the rental car key, have breakfast, drive to abq again, get on a plane, and fly home. if that sounds like a whirlwind, it definitely was. I spent more time in transit in those five days than I did sleeping, and at least 17 hours driving. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1456/0003.jpg)

A normal person would have thought ''three days in santa fe, great! I can have all the green chile breakfast burritos I want.'' Me, though, I thought, ''huh, that''s only an 8 hour drive from OKC, I can get a car and see people there too.''  

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1456/0004.jpg)
# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1456/0005.jpg)

On the drive east, I was thinking of it as "Matt''s Quixotic Adventure" because, firstly, there are a lot of windmills in eastern new mexico and the texas panhandle, which I learned is called the [llano estacado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llano_Estacado), and not a lot besides that. There are signs for the big steak in Amarillo, roadside attractions, and one large cross. A lot of cows in one spot, and a lot of grass (the brown kind you don''t smoke). If you''re lucky, there are good clouds; sometimes, if you''re luckier, you''ll see herds of antelope on the western edge of the Llano.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1456/0008.jpg)

Also, COVID ruined a bunch of our travel plans last year. Our visit to Oklahoma City to see relatives for 2021/2022 Winter break was marred by a couple different exposures that meant I didn’t get to see anyone we’d come to see. Sophie was a little luckier, but only because we saw her family on day one of the trip, outside, on an unseasonably warm day. Then, this last thanksgiving, Sophie’s mom got COVID and had to cancel her trip out to see us. So this trip (5 days start to finish) was to make up for all that and see everyone for at least a few hours. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1456/0009.jpg)
# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1456/0010.jpg)

But something else about this trip appealed to me, and that''s the very thin margins it operated on. This occurred to me on the drive west, as I was leaving Oklahoma City on four hours'' sleep. The whole trip was like a Rube Goldberg machine, where if everything goes just right, there aren''t any problems and it''s sort of amazing to see the toast get buttered or whatever at the end of all the steps. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1456/0011.jpg)

What actually happened was there was a drift away from the plan, minute by minute. For example, the second day, I got the car and then went to Meow Wolf with Sophie, dropped her off at her mom''s place, then got on the road maybe half an hour later than I wanted to. That drive was pretty uneventful; good clouds, a nice sunset (see pictures). I lost an hour when I crossed the border into Texas (because time zones). Smooth sailing and I got to my Dad''s house around 11:30pm instead of 10. I sat in the living room for a minute, and after we talked for just a minute, he said, "Oh, you''re _that_ tired, let''s just go to bed," and I was so exhausted I just did. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1456/0012.jpg)
# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1456/0013.jpg)

Before I know it, it''s 36 hours later and I''m back out at the edge of what''s possible, driving into the night, vents blowing cold air, tense from all the adrenaline metabolites and cortisol and caffeine and b vitamins and whatever the hell ''[taurine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurine)'' is.

It''s not a _good_ place to be, but it''s a place I feel at home. I''m fully aware of how silly it is. The silliness is part of what appeals to me, too. I could easily have planned a trip that had more days in it (except I don''t have more time off to use), but something about adding those extra margins, padding for safety, would have removed all the fun. Well, not all the fun, because the parts where I got to see family and friends were the point of the trip and fun in and of themselves, but adding that extra edge just makes the time I had with them a little bit brighter. Feels sharper, somehow. It''s not to see if I''m ''up to the challenge'' or anything macho, it''s just to see what happens. The edges are where the interesting things happen, after all.', '2023-01-12 09:08:47', '2023-01-12 09:25:05', NULL, '2023-01-12 09:20:02', 1, false, NULL, false, '{the_quixotic_adventure,matt''s_quixotic_adventure}');

Saudade means a profound longing or lonelyness, the emotion you feel for someone you love is a long ways a way, in time, space, or emotion. You say, when you''re leaving your beloved, ''Vou ter saudade de voce'' when you''re leaving, probably not on a trip, but when you know you won''t see them again for a while. It can be sad, but it''s also an expression of love.

Like I said, we were kind of staying in the tourist quarter, near the river, but the last day or two we wandered into town a little more; I went to a cigar shop and bought real Habanos, Cuban cigars, and the weather oscillated between clouds and sun. I think I was starting to get worn down from being on the road at that point.

Back to the Italy photos for a few more posts. I haven''t been slacking on blogging, but instead of posting I''ve been working on an overhaul of the edit page. Just spent some time getting websockets to work on the server. Now I''m going to go to bed. Please enjoy these photos of Rome, the day we couldn''t get into the pantheon because they only do tickets in advance and we were also very tired.

I had a teacher in high school who''s biggest pet peeve was the phrase ''first annual'', because, she said, if it was the first, then there was no way for it to be annual. An annual event, in her mind, was something that happened over and over again, every year. So first annual was something of an oxymoron. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1555/0002.jpg)

That said, I''m not sure she was right. It''s not wrong to say first of an annual series, if you intend to make it happen again. At worst, it''s a little aspirational. I don''t think that''s that much of a crime? Anyway, this was the first annual Driftwood Retreat I alluded to in the last post. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1555/0003.jpg)

It was at a house somewhere in the Sierra Foothills, south of Tahoe. Not actually super far from here for a drive; I think we got out there in about three hours? but also we avoided traffic by leaving at 10am. I took my then-new Noctilux with me, and shot with it a bunch all weekend. Protip: if you are shooting and your main light comes from a digital projector, make sure your shutter speed is slower than the refresh rate. I shot some of these under a projected light at 1/200th of a second, and it caused all sorts of issues. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1555/0004.jpg)

Some of the other photos I made black and white just because I feel like it. Either it was very dark or the light was monochromatic or blown out in one channel (which also happens when there''s only one color of light) and I don''t feel like taming the weirdness. The ones that can be color are. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1555/0005.jpg)

Anyway, the retreat: a bunch of people came together to make music and art and meals together, away from all our normal worries and cares. Very chill vibes, good company, good times. There was a table big enough to lay out all the San Pablo work prints on, the first time I got to see the whole thing at once. Still working on the order for that, but I should be moving into book design soon.

Working at warp speed to get ready for Yerevan in 12 days. The reason I went back and found these in the first place is I''m trying to put together a little book of my Driftwood work from the last year. I''d really like to have something with people in it to show folks there, so they can get a sense of what I do. Also I''d like to have something everyone who''s been to one of these can also get.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1577/0003.jpg)

So yeah, this was the Reunion dinner, which usually happens in the fall after Driftwood. This was the second or third time doing it, and it was really great to hang with everyone. We went to Sausage Factory, had a great meal, took MUNI back to the hotel, and then we went to afters where cameras weren''t allowed. Or maybe I didn''t feel like carrying mine any more. Not sure. I mean, it was just a fairly normal oontz oontz party, but the light is always terrible in clubs. The ROI of risking the $$$ camera just isn''t there.

_blogger''s note: I wrote this two weeks ago, late at night, and thought I''d come back to it in the morning, and then the protests in Minneapolis boiled over into the rest of the country, and now we''re talking seriously about police abolition. Never thought I''d see it. To be clear, it''s a wonderful first step, and something I didn''t probably make clear below is that these kind of moments aren''t always bad as in buried at the bottom of a hole in the ground; but unpredictable, for sure._ 

[Dan Hon](https://twitter.com/hondanhon/), over on twitter, keeps saying “Slowly, then all at once.” Everything seems to be humming along, approaching a new normal, and then a bunch of stuff happens and the bottom falls out of the world. So: There’s this idea out of Quantum Mechanics that says that the ground state of the universe, the quantum vacuum between particles, is not a true ground, that it isn’t really the ‘bottom’. The properties of that vacuum determine a lot of things about our world, like the fact that particles stick together to form atoms, atoms make bonds, etc etc. Real literal fabric of the universe, here. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1304/FD60FD71-24DB-4FF2-8F41-DE625F64ADDB.jpeg)

And, well, it’s possible that fabric is _not stable_, that we’re in what’s called a local minima. Imagine a waterfall. Now, imagine, some way down, there is a ledge, and on that ledge, over eons, there forms a pool. Water can hang out in the pool, and be pretty stable seeming. If someone jumps into it though, a lot of water will splash over, and continue hurtling towards the ground. 

Or, better yet, think of a big hole in the ground, maybe 10 feet deep and wide. It’s freshly dug, and the walls seem solid. Anyone who’s ever worked down in such a hole will tell you it isn’t. It seems OK because it’s in a little ledge of stability. When a car drives by or someone steps on the edge, adding energy to the system, it can kick the it out of the region of stability, racing down to a new ground state; in this case, you better hope nobody was in the hole (on a real construction site, they use trench plates braced against the sides to prevent such accidents). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1304/6814B040-5230-474C-96F4-04329B6D1788.jpeg)

And so other systems can exhibit the same behavior. The quantum vacuum may or may not be at a true ground state, and even if it isn’t, it might take more energy than the whole universe will ever have to kick it over. It’s something that keeps a very specific brand of nerd up at night (never me; I lack the maths skill to really be frightened).

Normal society is a sort of ground state, too. All the different systems that surround us and do stuff like cut down trees to produce toilet paper, deliver our mail, stock the shelves at the grocery store, those are all sort of the result of the system working (there are negative effects of the system ‘working’ too, which we call structural violence, but that’s another essay). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1304/20E63A2D-1629-4DFA-AF15-4F462EBD273E.jpeg)

So COVID-19 is a shock to that system. The first round of quarantine, the first 6 weeks or so, were the first new local minima. People baked bread and sewed masks and put up with the difficulties of isolation and waited. Many world governments used this time to get a handle on testing and tracing and are doing OK. America didn’t. We have an idiot in charge. So we’re right now kicking off a cascade into a new, lower state that may or may not be a real ground state. Anti-police protests in Minneapolis. Anti-mask protests by people that want to start a second civil war (look for the dudes in the hawaiian shirts and don''t trust them). 

_update, two weeks after the first draft_: Turns out the free fall isn’t out of our hands. The de-funding of the Minneapolis force is just a beginning. Shit, I’m hopeful. How long can we maintain this? How far can we go? Prison abolition? Reparations? Open borders? I haven’t been able to go out to the protests for medical reasons (I have a couple COVID-19 risk factors) but I’ve been donating and doing what I can from home.

_update, three weeks later_: I went to a protest! it was great! I decided that I cared more about showing up than my personal safety, and did as much as I could to mitigate the danger. photos are unrelated San Pablo and my hood.

These are actually from the night before the previous post. I''m trying to get ahead of the trend and give up entirely on linearity. I had looked at flights and arriving one day earlier plus a hotel was quite a bit cheaper, so I went for it. I feel like at the time I might''ve also been scheduling with the possibility that Sophie would come along. I don''t remember, it was last year and a while ago.

Downtown minneapolis was very strange. The 10 story condo seemed to have taken over from all other life forms, and they were all shiny and neat, except where a few of them were still under construction. I wonder how many winters all these new transplants will face before they give up and move somewhere warmer? When I lived there, we didn''t stay through a whole one. Moved in the late spring to West St. Paul, started the third grade, learned my times tables up to I think 6''s, had more than one recess cancelled because it was too cold (less than 10ºF), and moved to Oklahoma in December. The wind was cold _inside_ the dang truck. Terrible cold. You''ve heard of lake effects? This is a place that is swiss-cheesed with lakes. Anyway, I digress.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1564/0003.jpg)

In the middle of summer, that is to say June, it was passing fair and nice. The Football stadium, as I said, looked like an incursion from an alternate reality, or an alien spaceship had landed and the aliens had decided, on balance, to decamp for somewhere warmer. If they''d waited a bit I''m sure they could have bought a nice condo. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1564/0004.jpg)

Other than the odd stadium, the downtown was quiet on a Friday evening. I walked around for maybe an hour, then the rain started coming down, and I went back into my motel to watch the first presidential debates. Talk about things going non-linear on us, huh?

I remember this drive across the bridge; it was cloudy in the east bay, and then after Yerba Buena island, the fog closed in around me and all I could see were the cars around me and the structure of the bridge. I thought about ''casual domain shear'', which was an idea from the last half-good Neal Stephenson book, _Anathem_. Basically, if you''re sufficiently isolated from some part of physical reality, time runs differently; in the book there are monks that use this phenomenon (and other monks that talk about it ad nauseam, I said it was half-good).

Of course, we all know when you''re stuck in traffic, time is very plastic.

Oh boy, these pictures. Took a lot of doing to get them edited down to what you see here. I started with about 60. Anyway, that''s not really why I''ve been absent around these parts. Just a lot going on. Travel! Friends in town! Parties! All of which will eventually probably end up on this here blog. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1468/0002.jpg)

Had a bad moment there for a second where nothing was working and I couldn''t figure out why; turns out, the disk my server lives on only has so much capacity, and I blew through that and then some. at 70gb, there was nothing left. The main culprit was a piece of gallery software I no longer use, which had, in the past three years, amassed 60gb in one log file. `rm`''d that, restarted some things, and robert is your mother''s brother. Killed the gallery processes, while I was at it. I really should look at making a proper setup, separate app hosting and whatnot, but I like my little server. Like a hand raised dairy cow. That I forget to milk sometimes.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1468/0003.jpg)

About this trip: Puerta Vallarta is a really lovely little spot, although it exists, from what I can tell, purely for tourists. 50 years ago (70 maybe?) it was a sleepy fishing village. Now it''s something else entirely, although there are still some fishermen (and really good seafood besides). We were there with our friends Cason and Ryan, and met some new friends, Tom and Brandon. (there were a bunch of other nice folks we met who''s names I didn''t catch, if that''s you, sorry, I''ll buy you a slushie at blondie''s sometime). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1468/0004.jpg)

Anyway, as I was saying, these were a bitch to edit. It''s a very pretty place, PV. Lots of white painted buildings, gorgeous sunsets, nice beaches, the whole bit. Even at midday, there are all sorts of interesting textures (see above). Not only that, I was having a good time, in a good groove and managed to shoot a lot. So I had a lot of pictures I liked. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1468/0005.jpg)

Anyway. I managed to cut it to these 15. If I''d had more time, I probably could have made several different coherent edits of 8 from the top 30ish. I like these because there aren''t any that are what I think of as really plain. Like, I had a couple in the edit that were straight shots of the beach, either at sunset or midday. The sort of thing you''d expect in a photo essay about a beach destination. So I cut ''em. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1468/0006.jpg)

Took a long time though, and making the even tighter edit would have taken even longer, and I really just needed to put something out and move on with my life. I''ll show my friends the looser edit, leave this one here, and try to do better next time.

So, I was getting ready to leave to go to chicago, texted Kawan to see if he was going to drink and draw, and he said, no, I''m going to miss it tonight, it''s Day of The Dead in the city. I was instantly like, I should go and photograph that, even though I hadn''t packed and leave for chicago the next day.  Yeah, these photos happened before the ones it the last post. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1543/0009.jpg)

So I got to the mission about 7, 7:30, and start walking south on Valencia. I don''t really see much until I get to close to the 24th street BART station.  I came to the tail end of a parade, there was a group of dancers (next photo). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1543/0001.jpg)

Then I followed the crowds down 24th st, towards the park where there were other things still happening; art and live music and ofrendas (altars with pictures and other things that remind us of the dead, usually specific people). Food and flowers and pictures, candles and other lights. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1543/0002.jpg)

Then I ran around a bunch and took the rest of the pictures here.

Is it so much to ask of a bag to hold this stuff?</em></span> </span></p> <p>So, a couple weeks ago, a friend was looking for backpack recommendations. I told him about a company I’d heard good things about, GoRuck. One of my former bosses had one, and it looked really substantial. That led me to their web site, and I noticed they were having a sale on the GR1 in red, which is a pretty good looking bag. They talk the talk, too. The founder/CEO is ex-special forces, talking about toughness and blah blah blah. I ignored the blah blah blah, since the guy who recommended them was on the level, and picked one up.</p> <p>It came, ant he first thing I noticed about it was that the zipper wasn’t as smooth as it was supposed to be. They brag about the laptop zipper being open/closed 100 times to look for snags, but I guess the main compartment didn’t get that treatment even once. The second thing that stood out about this bag: it has a lot of seams. The seams are the most common failure point, so the more there are, the more likely there will be a failure. Thirdly: the straps that came on it were too short for me. I’m 6’2” and broad shouldered, so this may not be entirely their fault, but do they never wear winter coats?</p> <p>I was willing to forgive all that and give it a try, anyway. The straps aren’t molded, so they kind of feel like they’re falling off all the time, and there’s no chest strap, either. That may improve with break-in, but it’s not leather, so there’s not a ton of change you can expect to see. I took my seam ripper to the flag velcro, because I don’t like brands, and that branding is particularly strong in the wrong way.</p> <p>So, I wore it for about two weeks, including weekends. I wanted to see if it could really be an every day bag. It was too big, really, for the weekend, but fine on the bart and walk to work. When there was a laptop in the compartment, it rode well, as did my camera in the bottom, and the load of groceries I stuck in it. I cut 6” off the straps and sewed on another foot of webbing I had lying around, and that was pretty well solved.</p> <p>A word about good bag design: Good bags usually have two layers, for many reasons. The outer can be tough, and the inside softer, and the added layers mean that any small hole or tear in one doesn’t mean you’ll automatically lose things. Also, the inner liner is usually where good bags do some water proofing. The Rickshaw I’m switching back to is a prime example. It’s a nylon herringbone with scotchlite stripes out, and ripstop sailcloth in.</p> <p>The GR1 does not have a liner, so there’s only a single layer of cloth between your stuff and the elements. And while two layers of cordura is usually enough to keep out the rain, one is not. Today, it was raining steadily during my commute. Not, I should say, a torrential downpour, but wet enough that my pants were soaked but the time I reached BART. Not a hard slog through jungles or fording a river or crawling through mud like they hint you can do with their bag. Just a walk to the train, 20 minutes in steady rain. I got to work, and the things inside the bag were wet. When I got home, the things were wetter, probably from a puddle somewhere.</p> <p>So, that tears it. I got mad, wrote this review, and now I’m not mad. Hopefully someone will read this and avoid wasting the money. In summary: construction is good but overly complex, and likely to fail. Bag lacks basic ergonomic features that would make it much more wearable; design is too boxy, ill fitting. Not water resistant. Most of the stuff they brag about is marketing bullshit.</p> <p><em>In case you were worried about my stuff that got a bit wet: most of it is fairly water resistant, and there were some clothes in the bag that absorbed most of the moisture.</em></p>', '2020-04-04 21:09:19', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'goruck_gr1_is_a_bad_bag', '2016-01-20 06:53:28', 1, false, NULL, false, '{goruck_gr1_is_a_bad_bag}');

re-photography, as a genre, is usually about finding an old photograph, going to where it was taken, and making a new picture. It''s a study in changes over time. Some of these aren''t that, exactly, but I''m quite sure they''re a in a long line of pictures of the same subjects, things that have been photographed ad infinitum, just over and over and over.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1519/0012.jpg)

 So anyway, it was thursday, I had to mail the camera back the next day, and I hadn''t planned anything. But for some reason I hadn''t been able to sleep the night before, finally drifted off around 4am, and then woke up to my alarm and realized I was going to be completely useless if I actually tried to work. So, instead, I took a sick day and went back to sleep. Woke up around one and decided to make use of the time I had. I called a lift and had it drop me off near chrissy field. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1519/0013.jpg)

there''s definitely something about photographers that makes us want to both go to see the big stuff, the landmarks, the most interesting parts of the world, while also wanting to do _something different_. Go to a place that''s literally one of the most photographed objects in the world, and try to find something new or interesting to look at. It helps when the light is ''bad'' because all the obvious sweeping views are cut off at the knees. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1519/0014.jpg)

It also helped that I had a bunch of focal lengths to play with; 15, 21, and 50mm, with the 15 doing a lot more work than I''m used to doing with it. through-the-lens viewing is rad. I don''t want to be too anal retentive about most things, but my compositions are usually very precise. or at least I want things in the picture to be there I put them, not cut off weirdly at the edges.  

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1519/0015.jpg)

But sometimes in the end you go out to the stupid place everyone else goes and you take the stupid picture you''ve seen a million times, just to get it out of your system, like a song stuck in your head. And along the way, since you''ve got the camera out, maybe you see a few other interesting things. Maybe the bad light is just mood, from the right angle. sometimes, just getting the camera out and putting it to your eye is enough to get the brain in gear.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1519/0016.jpg)

of course, I don''t think anything here is terribly original. It''s not like I''m the first person to notice how cool the symmetry of the girders under the arch section of the bridge is, or the surface texture of the rust on these old anchor chains. Still: there are many like it, these are mine.

If I put more than about 10 in a given post, the page takes forever to load. So instead, I did something I’ve been meaning to do for quite a while. I made an embedded slideshow. It’s meant to have some animations, and captions, and I need to write the script that will atuo-generate one of these, and maybe I’ll get around to adding those eventually, but I don’t want to let perfect be the enemy of done here. It’s just a blog after all. Hand-rolled artisanal slideshow.</p> <p>So. If you recall the previous post, we crashed out early and woke up early due to jet lag, and so did our friends we were travelling with, and they suggested we try to get to this shrine for the morning golden hour. Half an hour cab ride plus 5am sunrise meant we sort of just had to drop everything and go, so we did.</p> <p>We got there early enough that there wasn’t really that many people there. None of the vendors were open. We got coffees from a vending machine on the way. If you haven’t had the experience, it’s a little like one of those starbucks double shot cans, but available black and hot. So, thusly energized, we started up the hill.</p> <p>When we started, I didn’t really grasp the <em>extent</em> of this place. I was thinking of the golden temple we’d seen the day before, which was spectacular, but small, and figured this would be something on the same scale. But no, this is a whole complex of shrines and sub-shrines, sprawled out on the side of a mountain. The hike to the top is about 2 hours of stairs, what with the constant stopping to take photos.</p> <p>But/and, there are gates the whole way. Some ancient stone ones, but too many orange wooden ones to count. They’re on different scales, at different spacings, and in various states of repair the whole way. At one point, we came across a spot with just a hole in the ground where a gate was going to be planted later that day. The mental state that all the repetition and variation and physical exertion produces is very strange. Or maybe it was from hiking on an empty stomach. Disorientation, along with a sense of wonder.</p> <p>So: definitely go. Definitely do it at dawn, before all the other assholes wake up (remember you’re an asshole too, in this scenario). Maybe bring snacks and water, although as you leave the temple mid morning, there are street food vendors that will sell you food that has no business being that good.</p>

So, this is a perfect example of what I was talking about in my last post: editing is hard, so I''m splitting the photos from my four (five?) day trip to Mexico City across three posts. I don''t even feel bad about it. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1510/0006.jpg)

Any reportage like this is necessarily just a tiny fraction of a moment in the life of a city. W Eugene Smith, the famous, the legend, went to make a story about Pittsburgh. Initially, he was supposed to shoot for a month, come back with 100 pictures. He ended up staying for two years. He still considered it incomplete at the end.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1510/0007.jpg)

No shade on Pittsburgh, it''s a fine city and I was happy to live near it during part of my childhood. But it''s a small city. And if that took one of the best documentary photographers to ever live a couple years to come away feeling like he hadn''t done the subject justice, then there''s no way I''m going to get anything but a tiny whiff of a place as big as Mexico City. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1510/0008.jpg)

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1510/0009.jpg)

What was that like? Well, it was like every other place I''ve been in Mexico, but more. The Monument to the Revolution (next two images) was definitely built by people that had seen pyramids and were unafraid to build very large monuments. Very cool to go up in and see the view from the top. Friend/co-worker Maria was also there, which helped quite a lot as she''s fluent in spanish and I can never seem to not mix in portuguese. Also on the trip but not with us that evening was Josh, who''s been my boss'' boss for two jobs now, and Todd, who was speaking at a conference (which was also the nominal reason for the trip; the extra days were on our own dime and well worth it). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1510/0010.jpg)

Also, just a lot of people? Think of Tokyo, or New York: millions of people living right up next to each other, doing every kind of human activity possible. There were definitely more and less dense areas, and the area we were staying in (Coyoacán) was definitely like, a nice part of town. Gardens and parks and good food, plus a nice plaza with those wolf (coyote?) statues in the fountain. Couple good coffee shops within walking distance of the hotel, that sort of thing. Also: great tacos. Everywhere I''ve been in Mexico that wasn''t a tourist spot has had its own unique take on tacos, and they''re all delicious. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1510/0011.jpg)

These photos go through the first full day, plus the following morning (I think? the timeline is a little fuzzy and I didn''t keep field notes ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯). I know I took that photo of the tree in the morning, and then we went off and did stuff. But that''s in the next post.

It''s a good, if probelmatic book. It''s stronly opinionated about what is and isn''t a good photograph, and how they are made. It''s helped greatly by the fact that the two authors are generally dead on. There''s a lot in there that is about half rhetorical trickery and half untrue. They completely miss the point of photography after, say, John Szarkowski''s tenure at MOMA, and of a lot of the legitimate criticisms of photography. The book oozes the subtext of two old men yelling at kids "Get off my Lawn!" That said, the descriptions of working methods, how to do the work of being a photographer, are invaluable, and would have saved me about 5 years of learning if someone had put the book in my hand 10 (12?) years ago. It''s way more practical than "_the mind''s eye_":http://www.amazon.com/Henri-Cartier-Bresson-The-Minds-Eye/dp/0893818755, but not as good as "_beauty in photography_":http://www.amazon.com/Robert-Adams-Photography-Defense-Traditional/dp/0893813680. I''m only halfway through, but I think I''ll finish it this time (last time I started it I couldn''t get over the old man tone of the thing). Totally worthwhile. I''ve got about three weeks, wall clock time, until I can replace my camera. Call it a month, by the time it ships to me. This is the longest I''ve been without a camera since I started photographing seriously in 1998. Even when I got hit by the car, breaking my 5d, I had a loaner. It''s really weird. It doesn''t help that I was in the middle of discovering a new subject, the ''signs'' project. One of the problems with _OBaP_: they think you can''t go out without a subject in mind and find one. It''s simply not true. It really seems absurd if you think about it, that you couldn''t dicsover something visual by working visually. It just requires a lot of patience. Now I''ve finally found something new to shoot, and it''s really exciting. I can''t wait till I''ve got something to shoot it with again. <div class="center"> ![](https://images.matt.pictures/on_''on_being_a_photographer''/453/0001.jpg) ![](https://images.matt.pictures/on_''on_being_a_photographer''/453/0002.jpg)

somewhat inauspicious start to the year today, I''m typing without my left index finger because it''s got some kind of infection, the antibiotics taking their sweet time to take it out. hopefully I''ll be back up to full strength soon. I have a heck of a backlog here (as always). I started writing a year in review of last year of just the places I travelled to and lost steam by the time I got to June. I probably am just going to give up on that since posts about last year as a whole are no longer timely. this has never been a news blog, despite my aspirations and what my highschool journalism teacher drummed into me. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1534/0003.jpg)

I realized looking at these photos though, which are from roughly October, that I''m missing some stuff from Sardinia and Porto. I need to chase though down. I probably have them edited (initial selects in photo mechanic) and just forgot the final step of dragging them into lightroom. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1534/0004.jpg)

My current workflow is a little convoluted, mostly because lightroom is slow and bad at organizing photos _en masse_ and the other tool I use, Photo Mechanic Pro, is not a developing tool. So I do an ''ingest'' step with Photo Mechanic, and that''s when I usually do a round of initial selects. just page through the photos in the loupe view and hit 3 (number on the keyboard, marks the ''star rating'' in the EXIF) on anything that I think has potential. Then I can filter the light table view by star rating and select the ones that I''ve just marked. Then I drag those into lightroom (select all, drag to the lightroom icon) and in LR I can do the exposure, color adjustment, and dodging and burning. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1534/0008.jpg)

Of course, I have ADHD, every step in the pipeline there is prone to me walking away and not coming back for some months. Shooting is a constant, but other than that I offload from my SD cards as I can remember to. Used to be an every day ritual, now it''s once every other week. I just don''t shoot as much.

A lot of people hate the 5 because it''s boring and long and there''s nothing to see but farms for a couple hundred miles. I understand that perspective because I also have felt that way at times. I think it''s actually a very interesting road once you look at it the right way, though. The interaction of the mountains either side of the central valley, the textures and shapes, all that green... Really what''s not to like besides five hours in the car?

Of course, the weather isn''t always benign; I''ve definitely come over these same passes in bumper-to-bumper traffic which is a different kind of misery. I don''t think that''s the road''s fault though.

This is almost just a dump of the photos. Almost. My friend Ash recently reported [a story from the border](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/21/1213597119/border-patrol-migrants-unofficial-camps-jacumba-california-desert), where they''re just dumping people (asylum seekers, but people first) on the side of the road, exposed to the elements. Freezing cold, no supplies from their captors. Local volunteers are bringing meals and water.  Just a really terrible situation.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1527/0002.jpg)

And anyway, Ash also writes for the NPPA; inasmuch as someone can have a column in an e-newsletter, they have a [column](https://nppa.org/news/655ea8eaaed429e65d34cafd). And in it, they asked for pictures of better, happier things. Amsterdam in the midsummer isn''t exactly a warm hug, but it is nicer than all of that. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1527/0003.jpg)

Anyway. Like I alluded to in the last post, I''m trying to catch up now that it''s the end of the year. There are so many photos I never posted, not just of this year but of the last decade.  Some kind of problem. But anyway, for now, the focus is on what I shot this year. Still got everything that happened in Italy and Portugal, and everything since. Are they events? just random photos? I don''t know.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1527/0004.jpg)

I really need to make a tighter edit of these, but this is where I got to in the several months since the trip. I think if I had a thesis, some core of meaning,  I could put together a really tight 10 images. Amsterdam in Bikes, maybe. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1527/0005.jpg)

It''s thanksgiving, by about two hours. Pies are baked. I should be in bed. I think that''s all the words I have in me for now. I''ll probably get better at it as I get back in the habit of doing this.

So I let it be that, and cut out the review parts. Sharpness is a bourgeois concept, and we will not speak of it further.</em></p> <p>I alluded to this in my last post, but I’m trying to be less fussy about composition. I’m not doing a typography or a field guide, and my subjects are always moving. I must get closer, make suggestions, and don’t show the whole thing. It calls for simplification in technique, and an increase in creativity. I’ve always seen the two somewhat in opposition, since my mind has limited, feeble resources. Zoom lenses works against this of-the-moment aesthetic.</p> <p>A photograph will never be perfect on purpose. Maybe some photographs, of static subjects, shot with deliberation and care, will be great. Ansel certainly thought so. Weston too. But: their subjects are not my subjects, and out in the world where things are not fixed, you have to be ready to push the button when the moment is right. It’s a matter of a tenth of a second, much of the time. It reminds me of a description of swordfighting; if you try to think, it’s too late; it’s all feeling and intuition. One less thing to fiddle with is one more chance for serendipity to enter the field.</p> <p>The physical restriction of a fixed focal length lens actually grants a degree of creative freedom. If you can select a range of options, you’ll do the easiest thing. Pick the cleanest, simplest composition. Try to place the borders of the frame clear of the edges, include the whole subject, and follow all those other neat little rules they tell you in silly books that pretend art has rules. When there’s a restriction of form, confined to one focal length, you have to arrange what’s in the frame by moving and waiting for the moment. You’re forced to see for yourself, and look outside the lines.</p> <p>There’s also the reduced cognitive load for not having to pick a focal length; you put the camera to your eye, frame, and shoot. Cognitive load is the mental strain of whatever you’re thinking about, and you only have so much of it in a day, and only so much bandwidth at any given time. So, to juggle shutter speed, aperture, focus, ISO, focal length, composition, and timing, all at once, is really quite difficult. Much of that you can get away with setting once in a while, but it has to be part of your thinking somewhere, or the photos don’t work. So: if you can remove one of those questions, suddenly you have increased capacity for the others.</p> <p>Zooms are not without use, to be sure. A ton of working photographers do a ton of good work with zooms, and I’ve shot many pictures I really like with them as well. But there’s another way. If you’re not doing the work you think you should be doing, try one out.</p> <p><span style="display:block;" class="center"> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/in_defense_of_prime_lenses/341/0001.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/in_defense_of_prime_lenses/341/0002.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/in_defense_of_prime_lenses/341/0003.jpg" alt="" /> </span></p>', '2020-04-04 21:09:31', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'in_defense_of_prime_lenses', '2015-12-15 07:19:46', 1, false, NULL, false, '{in_defense_of_prime_lenses}');

So this is from the second party of our new year''s. We had a couple friends over earlier in the evening, and those pictures may or may not be on the other camera, but I downloaded these first. The friends party was over and we were supposed to be getting in bed because there was a morning plane to Albuquerque that we were supposed to be on, and the whole [week of adventure](https://matt.pictures/the_quixotic_adventure) after that. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1462/0002.jpg)

Instead, when Sophie texted our neighbor to wish them a happy new year, they said, we''re having a party, come over. So we did. There was a fire outside and karaoke inside, along with a bunch of potluck dishes, and punch that was mostly booze with sugar to cover it up. It was actually really nice to get to hang out, even though we paid for it the next day.

These are in black and white and still a bit motion blurred, in case you''re wondering, because my little pocket camera was at ISO 8000 and shutter speeds were in the 1/4 to 1/2 second range. I''m good at hand-holding but I can''t make the world be still.

The gist of it is, they aren''t blogging for the foreseeable future, and might not blog ever again. The reason they give is that blogs aren''t a good platform for quality content.

Even if/when they do come back, if it''s as several blogs or as one feed, if the focus becomes more about dialogue than content, I think they''re missing something big.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/why_magnum_needs_a_blog/1137/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />To say that blogs aren''t a good place for quality content is <a href="http://www.todayandtomorrow.net/">ignorant</a> <a href="http://www.americansuburbx.com/">and</a> <a href="http://curatedby.jon-kyle.com/">misinformed</a>. (Links go to rebuttal examples.<a href="http://www.burnmagazine.org/">Also this</a>). Those are all blogs, all that I''ve come across recently; there are countless sources of good content on the web, places that have really brilliant content, displayed well. The last one is a community effort, and in fact arose because of a group of people looking for a place. So, to shut down a blog to build a community seems silly. Why not blog the process of making the new site?<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/why_magnum_needs_a_blog/1137/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Why aren''t the photographers of Magnum, surely some of the world''s finest visual storytellers, blogging themselves? (With the notable exception of David Allen Harvey, who runs Burn magazine, of course). It''d be the best group blog ever, if they would embrace a little technology; the best eyes in the world, reporting daily what they see. From the perspective of one who does it, who has done it now for going on two years (with a little hiatus between the end of the santa fe blog and the start of this one), it''s not hard at all to knock out a blog post a day, sometimes two or three. Especially if all it consists of are photos with captions. Every other day is even easier; even when I was working full time at a job that had nothing to do with my photography, I still did that.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/why_magnum_needs_a_blog/1137/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />I guess part of the problem is that to get a group of photographers to do anything together is something like herding cats; if you''ve ever walked in a city with even four or five of us you know what I''m talking about; it takes two or three times as long to get somewhere (even dinner) because the whole group sort of wanders off after a picture, and then the rest have to wait, and by the time the one gets back someone else has wandered off. Now imagine a group like that, all self-interested, agreeing to do something like a group blog, to share space on the web with anyone else?<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/why_magnum_needs_a_blog/1137/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Thinking that way is really wrong-headed. Separate channels for each photographer presume that each one is doing enough to hold a reader''s interest indefinitely, and that readers of one photographer won''t be interested in others. It''s silly. The truth is, group blogs of like minded people (or at least people who are all talking about the same things) usually have more readers and better content than single author blogs. Think <a href="http://laist.com/">LAist</a>, <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>, or blogs like that. The rising tide lifts all boats. And, because there are other people out there doing the same thing in the same space, you''re apt to learn and improve your own content as time goes on.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/why_magnum_needs_a_blog/1137/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />Of course, nobody listens to me, or at least nobody at Magnum.', '2020-04-04 22:02:43', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'why_magnum_needs_a_blog', '2009-07-30 00:00:00', 1, false, NULL, false, '{why_magnum_needs_a_blog}');

I’ve talked about making [stuff](https://matt.pictures/post/i_made_a_pepper_grinder_) in the [past](https://ourglass.watch) but something that’s always confounded me is just how long it takes to get anything done. If I had to define a process for ‘how to make anything’, it’d look something like this: 

1. design the shape of the thing
2. figure out the parts you’ll need to make the thing
3. buy the parts you can, make what you can’t
4. assemble the parts into the thing

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1463/0002.jpg)

Anyone who’s made stuff knows that any one of these steps can take an unlimited amount of time. And step three is actually fractal; any given part can be made up of its own parts. In my bags, usually there’s a complex front piece that has pockets, and organizers in those pockets; the organizers are made of of several pieces of fabric in turn, et cetera.

Anyway, I’m what’s known as a [chaos muppet](https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/06/chaos-theory.html). Think Fozzie the bear versus Bert or Animal versus Kermit. It could be the ADHD, or it could just be me (the fuzzy line between disorder and personality is a different essay). And I’ve always thought I paid some penalties for that, in terms of getting stuff done. Like, if only I was organized, I would be able to just move through the steps in an orderly fashion, and turn out finished products (bags, photos, blog posts, what have you) by rote, no problem.

One of the things I love about youtube is some real geniuses of different trades have channels and produce videos about making stuff. There’s folks like [Quinn Dunki](https://www.youtube.com/@Blondihacks) machining on home setups not dissimilar to my studio, all the way up to big production shops like [Adam Booth](https://www.youtube.com/@Abom79). Some are explicitly instructional, like [Ron Covell](https://www.youtube.com/@RonCovell) (he of the metalworking books, his channel is Bob Ross for sheet metal I swear), and some are more ‘this is what we’re doing in the shop’ but with enough detail that if you’re conversant you can figure out how to reproduce what they do.

<span class="caption">I took a version of this picture every day; this was the best one.</span>

[Paul Brodie](https://www.youtube.com/@paulbrodie) is one of the latter. Just a really excellent fabricator, who had a business building custom bike frames, was apparently renowned for such, and is now in retirement up in Canada, doing one off custom work on bikes and motorcycles. “Build whole engines from scratch” levels of fabrication. Brodie’s shop is immaculate, organized to a T. He’s the picture of an order muppet, and he has every tool he could want at his disposal. Lathe and mill and all sorts of jigs accumulated over years of making things out of metal; TIG and MIG welders, as well as Oxy/Acetalene torch equipment, and plenty of material in his stock racks. It’s not a huge shop, but plenty of space to do the work he does.

He recently posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXc0bUGFvtY) of making a fender mount for a rare Honda race bike. Well, it was a kit bike that was raced or something, that part doesn’t matter. The fender mount was a single piece of sheet aluminum, bent in a big radius to go around the tire, plus some smaller bits of tubing with little welded bosses to make it meet with the mounting points. At the end of the video, he had a little bit where he was like, “Guess how long it took me to make this?” because it was a client project, he had tracked his hours. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1463/0007.jpg)

My initial guess was 8 hours. Not only is he in a good shop, but he’s old, and contrary to what you might think, older craftsmen move faster. There’s an economy of movement and lack of going down wrong paths that means they don’t have to like, redo work or stand and think about the order of assembly or anything, it’s just ‘the way it worked last time’ to do any given task. The big reveal, at least to me, was that it took him 19 hours to build this one fender mount. So I guess I should just take it easy on myself. How long will it take? As long as it needs.

Sophie is gonna hate this one, because she hates photos of herself, but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ she''s in Amsterdam and can''t get mad at me. Or she could, but she won''t be back for a week and by then this post will be pushed way down the page where she won''t see it. Shh don''t tell her.

I _thought_ I had posted these earlier, maybe they''re in a draft post somewhere. This was a saturday after we got back; the occasion was to try out a new book of cocktail recipes they had gotten us for christmas. Vinyl and Booze, and we had a bunch of vinyl and a bunch of fancy cocktail ingredients. I tasted stuff but didn''t have full drinks, because of my gout. Still, fun, and the excuse to get together and listen to music was quite nice. The proposed ratio of one (fancy, mostly hard liquor) drink per side was a bit much for everyone that was having full glasses, but we managed.

The M11 came this week. I bought it at the end of last week and it was shipped ground (dang ebay sellers). But it was whole and as advertised, like new. less than a thousand clicks on the shutter, not a mark on it. I charged up the battery and I''ve been shooting with it since Saturday (friday I was out of commission mostly due to insomnia). So far, so good. I want to make a shutter lag testing rig, just a bit of software to see how long it takes me to react and get a picture. I can test it with cameras that feel fast and feel slow and put numbers to my feelings.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1501/0005.jpg)

The feeling, right now, is the M11 is fast enough, but that might change at any moment. I haven''t shot any real fast action with it yet. It''s not a sports camera but getting _[images à la sauvette](https://www.icp.org/exhibitions/henri-cartier-bresson-the-decisive-moment)_ is not a slow camera game. TBD, and more as it develops.

I took these one evening after a ball game my then current employer had taken us all to, "us all" being like four or five people? Giants won if I recall correctly. I think we walked all the way to Rickhouse? Anyway. There were drinks. A good time was had.

Sometimes, when work is more or less just me, working on a problem for a long time, it''s good for my head to get out of the house. I think this week I was also solo, Sophie was somewhere; Chicago? Amsterdam? I don''t remember. Anyway. "It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation," to steal a sentence. SFMOMA has a nice cafe, and a couple little nooks scattered throughout the museum that are great for this, as they also have decent wifi and the 5G coverage is excellent. I''m a museum member, so I get in free (well, something like $150/year).

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1520/0012.jpg)

I''m not worried about spoiling the uncrowded space, nobody reads blogs. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1520/0013.jpg)

But it''s great, I can work for a little bit, go look at some art if I get restless, get a coffee from the cafe, whatever I feel like. I''m always really productive because of the slight pressure of not wanting people to see me goofing off on my phone or whatever. There''s also the "I can do that later" thought that helps; I''m in a rad place, I should either be looking at the rad art or doing work, not scrolling.

If you want to know about taking photos, there''s a ton of good literature out there. There is a whole subset of phototographers who think that the techniques of photography (exposure, sharpness, depth, grain/noise, etc) are an end unto themselves, but this is a false path. But the fact that they exist and are there to tell us what the rules are so we can break them effectively is a good thing. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="https://images.matt.pictures/photography_as_a_new_liberal_art/1138/0001.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="https://images.matt.pictures/photography_as_a_new_liberal_art/1138/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />The idea of "New Liberal Arts" comes from <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/">Snarkmarket</a> and their interesting if incomplete book <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/nla/">New Liberal Arts</a>, which is based around the idea that to function intelligently in society today, there is a new skillset outside of the traditional lines of the liberal arts. The main point of learning liberal arts is to learn how to think critically about the world. Since it''s my area, and since the chapter in the book is one of the areas that comes up short, I thought some expansion was called for in the area of thinking critically about photographs. These are all just starting points, ideas, and not rules forever. <br /><br />The first most important consideration when looking at a photograph is the content of the picture. A photo is a two-d simulacra of the 4-d world; It takes a cone of space (the angle of view) and a slice of time (the shutter speed) and reduces that to an image on a piece of paper, or more commonly now, a screen. There are parts in and out of focus, there is a limit to the detail that can be seen (and no software, no matter what CSI tells you, can bring back detail from a pixelated image). There is a perspective, and by this I mean a camera position, high or low, close to the subject or far away. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="https://images.matt.pictures/photography_as_a_new_liberal_art/1138/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="https://images.matt.pictures/photography_as_a_new_liberal_art/1138/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />What does this mean to us, the viewer? Any rendering of a scene is only a partial rendering; at any given time there are an infinite number of perspectives and the same infinite gradation of moments that the camera can have, and we are seeing only one. I am categorically opposed to the idea that all of these perspectives are equal (relativism be damned, it''s solipsism with a coat of postmodern paint). Some moments are better than others, and if that weren''t the case, there would be no art in photography. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="https://images.matt.pictures/photography_as_a_new_liberal_art/1138/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="https://images.matt.pictures/photography_as_a_new_liberal_art/1138/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />A photo can be evidence, it can tell a (short) story, but through selection of moments and perspectives, the photograph can tell a lie, too. It is impossible to tell by looking at a photograph if it is true or false. The only thing that can be determined is if it has been altered after the fact. This is why people are always so aghast when someone is caught photoshopping news pictures, because it disturbs their questionable belief in the veracity of the medium of photography. It''s a religious belief, one which has no grounding in fact; you''d see similar responses if you went in front of a church congregation and gave them a logical proof of atheism (ask a Jesuit, they really do exist, but reality is not wholly logical anyway). <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="https://images.matt.pictures/photography_as_a_new_liberal_art/1138/0007.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="https://images.matt.pictures/photography_as_a_new_liberal_art/1138/0008.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />So, a photo can''t be true or false from the perspective of a viewer, and here I''m only talking of candid pictures, not staged or manipulated after the fact. I can walk into a party and make 300 pictures, and just in the selection of what to show, make it look like the best party ever or the worst time anybody has ever had outside of torture chambers. Neither is true. Or they both might be.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="https://images.matt.pictures/photography_as_a_new_liberal_art/1138/0009.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img class="photo" src="https://images.matt.pictures/photography_as_a_new_liberal_art/1138/0010.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Ok, that''s all the lesson I have in me today.

I almost titled this one ''posting hole'' for reasons that will become obvious once you scroll down. I made that post last week and then promptly got busy not posting any more. I did, as you can see, find the missing photos from our fall trip to Italy and Portugal. These are from our brief stay in Rome, arriving late in the evening and leaving the next afternoon. 
  
# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1535/0002.jpg)

I have some notes here towards an essay about how I don''t want to end up like W. Eugene Smith in Pittsburgh. Smith was, if not the inventor of the picture-story, then one of the first real masters of it. Incredible pictures, you should look him up. [Country Doctor](https://www.magnumphotos.com/newsroom/society/w-eugene-smith-country-doctor/) and [Minamata](https://www.magnumphotos.com/arts-culture/society-arts-culture/w-eugene-smith-minamata-warning-to-the-world/) and [also here''s a good essay on his work in general](https://www.magnumphotos.com/theory-and-practice/w-eugene-smith-master-of-the-photo-essay/). Anyway, in the middle of his career, freed from his contract with LIFE magazine, he took a job to spend 3 weeks in the city of Pittsburgh, produce some photos for a book that was already in process. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1535/0003.jpg)

Instead, he ended up staying for two years. At the end, he owed everybody money, the people that had initially hired him had moved on, his relationship with his photo agency had turned sour (it may have ended altogether, it''s been a while since I had photo history class). He was lost in the vastness of what he''d uncovered, just like, scratching the surface and seeing what he thought was the real Pittsburgh and trying to get it down on film.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1535/0004.jpg)

I think, when confronted with a story where there was no through line, no simple message, his little tool kit of classic storytelling (classic may not be the right word? but I''m thinking in contrast to, say, Winogrand''s nihilism or Robert Frank''s, well frankness) just fell apart. It was too big for him; not the city but the multiplicity of stories, the necessarily fractured view that trying to take in a whole city brings. He wasn''t able to deal with the contradictions inherent in a place with that many people. I say ''deal with'' but I really mean put together a photo essay in the narrative mode he was used to from the city at all. That kind of storytelling just can''t be applied with that broad of a subject matter, there are too many things working at cross purposes. Imposing a narrative at that scale, or trying to find one latently, just like, shooting and hoping to get something other than your own projected self, is just impossible.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1535/0005.jpg)

Is this sounding familiar? Because it''s also me, trying to make San Pablo work for the last five and a half years. I started out thinking it would be a couple weeks of shooting, and then it stretched out, and suddenly I was a bit lost, lacking a compass. Probably didn''t have a firm point of view, from which to really see what I was looking for. That said: the photos are also a record of what I was feeling at the time, the way I responded to the place. If you get enough pictures, or maybe just the right ones, you can kind of get a feel for the person who was taking them, a reverse-psychogeography. It''s a latent image, not something you try for but something you see in review.  

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1535/0006.jpg)

There are a lot of approaches to bigger subjects (a comparison of, say, Robert Frank''s approach versus, say, William Eggleston''s, might be interesting), but obsessively continuing year after year isn''t one of them. So anyway, that''s what I''m working on. A final edit, working through the years until I''ve got all the San Pablo together, and then I''ll hopefully have a book. Or, I will have a book, but hopefully it''ll be something worthwhile.

these photos were taken a couple weeks ago now, at a weekly dance party that started back in 2020 called [Days Like This](https://www.instagram.com/dayslikethis.oakland/). Friday night, 5-9:30, just impeccable vibes. really great fun. The first couple were from before, we went to Coach and had sushi before dancing. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1566/0002.jpg)

despite the fact that the break dancing is the majority of the pictures here, it only really lasted a couple songs. We got to the party late, around 8ish, danced for a while, and then I took a bunch of pictures. I found myself screwing around with the focus modes, trying to find the right one. I think I landed on the 3d-tracking mode? Honestly modern AF is black magic to me, and I''m probably going to spend a little time learning it, because it''s a neat trick to have when the situation arises. 8 frames a second doesn''t hurt, either.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1566/0003.jpg)

I am woefully behind on editing photos, I still haven''t gotten through the stuff from Driftwood and that was back in August. Had something of a block about it, unfortunately. The photo sets are large and mean a lot to me so I want to get them right (whatever that means) and so I want to do them when I have time to just sit with them but I never do; there''s no increment of time large enough to really digest that many photos into a coherent set.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1566/0004.jpg)

I am making progress, though. I have a method I think of as the ''bangers only'' method. When I''m doing my initial selects, I do a pass and bring anything that might work once I''ve punched it up a bit, and then I do a pass toning all of those (global exposure, white balance, etc) and then often this is where my process stalls. I''ll have 60 or 100 photos in a collection, from several days of work, and I''ll have to choose from those, and I just can''t say no to any of them. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1566/0005.jpg)

That''s where the next step comes in; I have to say ''yes'' to the picture to get it past this step. No ''maybe'', no ''if I squint'', just the ones that are definitely good by my judgement. That usually helps. I got this set down from 50 to 15 in like five minutes (it helped that there were a couple blurry sequences and obvious winners in there). Driftwood 2024, the edit went from 120 to 49 very quickly. I need to do this for the Retreat photos as well, and then hopefully I''ll have both of those posts out soonish. I''m also thinking about doing a book? Maybe? DW 2024 and Retreat 2025. Maybe.

It''s 6am Central European Daylight Time, day four of the trip, and the jet lag has really caught up with me. I''ve been awake since 3:30 or so local time. Really just processing some photos to kill some time, and hope I can get back to sleep again. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1521/0012.jpg)

Took these on a walk up into some park or another. It was supposed to be a little piece of a 6 mile loop that included redwoods, but we went to the wrong trailhead, didn''t bother looking at the map, and ended up making the walk rather short as a consequence. While we were walking, I had the idea for a blog that would have killed in 2003 or so: "That''s a good tree," a blog that just had posts of individual pictures of trees that I saw, with the caption "That''s a good tree." 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1521/0013.jpg)

Of course, it''s 20 years after that would have been fun, and in 2oo3, digital cameras were in their infancy; for what I just spent on a top of the line body and lens, you could get maybe six whole megapixels, with slightly worse than slide film dynamic range. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1521/0014.jpg)

Then, before we got in the car to head home, we walked across the road and I took this panorama, with the fog rolling over the hills in SF, Tam on the right, and yes, another good tree. It''ll print something like 80 inches wide, which might be interesting. We''ll see when I''m back to my big printer.

Today''s [today in tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/p/rip-websites) had as its kicker a link to a list of "things that don''t work." I won''t link to it because it has a certain smell about it, a smell of mixing things that are obviously true with things that are just one guy''s opinion and some that are just plain wrong. I read a few of the other things on the site and there''s a nasty undercurrent to the dude''s writing. That kind of smell. Anyway.  

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1547/0002.jpg)

One of the obviously true things on his list of things that don''t work was "quality over quantity" (again that smell, generalities when talking about something specific). But the specific thing is this: you don''t make good art by just making one thing, you make it by making a bunch of stuff. Austin Kleon [has it](https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/) as "Quantity _leads to_ quality" (my emphasis) which is a much better way to formulate it. Anyway.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1547/0003.jpg)

All that to say, I''m gonna try to blog more? I certainly have the pictures. While there may be some stinkers in there, the practice is good for me. I definitely feel my writing get better and words come more easily as I do it more. Daily would be great but I''m not going to make that, there''s too much going on. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1547/0004.jpg)

These are all from a couple days last november, before thanksgiving. I don''t know why I grouped them, but there they were in my edits. Just walking around the neighborhood. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1547/0005.jpg)

Sidenote: when I see stuff that''s obviously just someone''s opinion stated as fact, I fall back on the line from The Big Lebowski: "Yeah, well, ya know, that''s just like, uh, your opinion, man." I didn''t really mark it until I read Jeff Bridges'' book _The Dude and the Zen Master_, where there''s a whole chapter with that as the title, about non-attachment. The conceit of the book is a little hokey, but there''s some good stuff in there.

I usually try to break these up, but it''s turkey day, and I don''t have anything else really queued up at the moment. I ran through these and cut out all the really boring ones, just for you, dear reader. Amsterdam is a weird little town, at least in the hot center where we were staying. I may have explained this before, but I was there because Sophie''s work brought her out, and I found a deal on a multi-city ticket; with the free hotel it ended up not costing very much at all. Working east coast hours meant I had the mornings to sleep in and the dinner hour hardly starts when I would sign off. Really quite pleasant.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1528/0003.jpg)

But back to the town, and its weirdness: the tourists were kind of the worst? I''m pretty sure I talked about how bad the sidewalks were in the mornings. But also: every dutch person I met had an air of practicality, of business. Well, except the poor waitstaff at ever restaurant, who were just Tired. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1528/0004.jpg)

There''s something to that, the weird dichotomy of excess and practicality. I don''t know. Lots of bikes, too.

I can''t believe people actually think like that, that the solution to driver negligence (which is almost always the case of bike accidents involving a bike and a car) is for cyclists to not ride their bikes. <br /><br />I ride a <span >road bike</span>. I ride it on the road because it''s made for pavement, and because it''s illegal for me to ride on the sidewalk. For a lot of miles of my riding, there are no sidewalks. Bike trails are nice where the exist, and I don''t mind dodging pedestrians and slower cyclists even, but the trails almost never go anywhere useful. I ride in the middle of the lane because that''s the safest place for me to be. I am more noticeable and to pass me you have to use the other lane. I''m almost never on roads that don''t have a passing lane, at least when traffic is an issue. Every cyclist with any experience knows the roads with the best pavement and least traffic to get where they are going, and new cyclists often hear about them the first time they meet other riders (''You take 10th st all the way from where? no no no, take 4th to downtown, then...'').<br /><br />If you''re a driver, watch where you''re going and don''t drive drunk, ok? I see a lot of people bitching on the internet about aggro/self righteous cyclists, but if a random cyclist started killing drivers at random, and got away with it (hit and runs are the rule), wouldn''t you be mad at them? This case would have been just like that, if an eyewitness hadn''t run the driver off the road to stop her.<br /><br />Fact: you have to double or triple your speed to reduce time traveled by a significant amount when driving in town. That means that even a full 60 seconds waiting behind a cyclist (this is a lot longer than you think) going 15 mph waiting to pass is only going to slow you by about 30 seconds in your overall travel time. You spend more time than that sitting at red lights, making coffee or chatting with co-workers. Hell, I spend more time staring at the wall persuading myself to get out of bed. It''s not worth getting upset over and certainly not worth killing some poor guy who''s just trying to get somewhere. <br /><br />If you''re a cyclist, be careful. You''d look hotter in a helmet, and by hotter I mean sexier without head injuries. Use lower traffic roads, lights, and bright clothing. Of course, none of that helped me this last time, but I know it''s saved me a thousand other times. Don''t be an asshole, but take the lane, it''s yours by law, and if you''re off to the side, it''s easier to go unnoticed. If a driver is coming towards you, yell at them, whatever you feel like yelling, as loud as you can. More than once yelling "HEY!" has saved my bacon.<br /><br />I think that''s all.

Part two not day two; the days have run together. Pretty sure this was mostly Sunday, though. Something I meant to say in my essay yesterday but didn''t because I''m a bad writer (or rather at least someone who just publishes his first drafts) is just how green of a city the DF is. Huge parks, lots of trees. More than other cities? Definitely more green than NYC. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1511/0002.jpg)

We visited a history museum, and it was pretty fascinating to see they way they tell the story; I studied the Mexican revolution in college (one of the three profs in my political science department did his doctoral work in Chihuahua), but of course I was reading english language, and thus american-slanted versions of the whole story. A set of facts isn''t a story, and so the story they told with basically the same facts was interesting. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1511/0003.jpg)

For example, the [Porfiriato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porfiriato), the post-[french king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_I_of_Mexico) nominal republic that is told in US history as a dictatorship in all but name, is regarded as a period of relative peace and prosperity, at least by the museum wall texts. I do wonder if there''s as much controversy over them there as there is here? Like the wall texts in many US museums that referred to my ancestors as ''savages,'' sometimes adding ''noble''. Not a huge fan of those myself.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1511/0004.jpg)

After the museum, there was a nice walk through a park. The museum had a no food/drink policy, so immediately after getting out we were all dying of thirst. I drank a liter of gatorade and another half of water while we wandered towards lunch. Which was in the wildest food court I''ve ever been in. Outdoors, but with a bazillion umbrellas sort of interlocked like a Greek phalanx''s shields. Pleasantly shady underneath. So, outdoors-but-sheltered, and then the kicker: there was table service! Really, can''t be beat. Delicious food, too.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1511/0006.jpg)

Then we got into a car and sped across the city. Well, relatively across the city. I don''t know. Our colleague Moses keeps an apartment there with his fiance, and they have access to a rooftop pool. They found out that we were in town and invited us over for an afternoon party at the pool. It was a great time; really lovely folks, I got to meet a bunch of the family etc. Beers were drank, cigars were smoked. I had forgotten my bathing suit, so our host offered to run across the street to wal-mart to get one. They brought back the biggest pair of trunks WalMart sold, and it was... barely big enough to get on. No pictures because I embarass myself enough as it is.

Then, a truly spectacular sunset, complete with stratocumulus clouds forming over 
other, distant parts of the city. I had a real hard time editing the pictures of the view down to just these two. If you held a gun to my head and made me pick between these two? not sure I could.

When I was in college, I had a professor that did a bunch of field work in Northern Mexico, I want to say in Chihuahua, but it may have been one of the other states. Anyway, besides relating to us what most of the people there really wanted in life (clear title to their land), he alsa told us that in the bars there, you never order ''ultimo'' for the last drink of the night, because that would be the last drink _ever_.

Now this was the same guy that came up with the _coyote-pendejo_ spectrum, and placed himself at the bottom intentionally, so maybe take that with a grain of salt, but I do like the idea. The implication, on the last real day of the trip, that there will be another. These photos, appropriately, are from the second to last day of this trip. It was the last day of substance, for sure.

[Teotihuacán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan) is a complex of three large pyramids, and many smaller temples and sites of archeological importance. I won''t bore you with a history lesson, except to say that the folks that built them saw their whole civilization collapse. It was the 6th largest city in the world at its peak, more than just a religious center or burial monument like the ones in Egypt. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1512/0005.jpg)

Anyway, all of that was a long time ago, and now it''s a place where you can visit and be awed and a little sad that it''s all gone. We took an uber to the main entrance, and immediately got sold a tour on quad bikes, which was actually a pretty decent way to get around. They took us to some fun little shops, I bought sophie a gift, then we parked the quads and walked into the actual preserve, where there are no motor vehicles for the tourists.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1512/0006.jpg)

It''s a big place. I don''t know if the pyramids are larger than the ones at Giza, but the walk is definitely longer. We walked from the back gate to the Pyramid of the Moon, by way of the Pyramid of the Sun, and then to the temple at the other end of the compound, which you get to by crossing a dozen pre-columbian staircases, up and down, both ways. My travelling companions were both fine. Me, that hasn''t seen the inside of a gym nor had a season of travel and being out-of-doors in far too long, well, I was pretty wiped. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1512/0007.jpg)

We spent too long, well, went around to see everything we wanted to see, and by the time we got back to the quads, the last place on the quad tour was closed. The dude took us to the bus stop, where we decided discretion is the better part of getting back to the hotel and ordered an uber again. While we waited I drank a liter of gatorade and then another half a liter of water. Little bit dehydrated. The ride home was pretty uneventful; good light, sunset. The sign that pointed to Cairo, maybe not mocking me, but for sure a sign of something.

So, as some of my longtime friends know, I’m hard on my personal effects, be they the string of watches I wear, the cameras I carry, my bikes, my tools, my phone, laptops, everything. This extends to the kitchen, where the average life of a glass is about a year. Pots and pans tend to be a little banged up, before I switched to aeropress I was always needing a new glass carafe for my french press coffee. Damn I miss french press sometimes. Anyway. 

I’ve also been through a number of pepper grinders, the last of which was both really nice (consistent, ground pepper quickly, needed no batteries) and not so nice (plastic) and broke after only a few months. I took it apart and looked at it, and saw that I could replace all the plastic parts with aluminum, quickly mocked up a design in my head, and bought some material to turn the parts on the lathe. I also did a repair on the plastic, to keep us in fresh ground pepper in the mean time. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1398/IMG_4091.jpg)

Fast forward a month. I’ve got all the tooling I think I need, and I’m in the shower, thinking through the kinda complex design I came up with initially. It had two flanges, a main body, and a cap, and I didn’t know exactly how the shaft that connected the burrs to the top would connect. The flanges would have required cutting a bunch of internal and external threads, and just a lot more work in general. And then, there in the shower, I realize: I can just weld a little threaded rod to the end of the shaft, and then not need all the complicated extra flanges; the cap could just spin on the main body and be held in place with nuts above and below. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1398/IMG_4090.jpg)

So, even if you can’t understand my description, you can kinda see that the second one is a lot simpler. It was simple enough I was confident I could make it. That same day, I started cutting material. I cut the main body out, drilling and then boring out to 1.5” about half way down my work piece. I also cut the little shoulder on the top that the cap rides on. Then, I parted off at the right length, flipped the part with a soda can shim over the finished surface, and started boring the bottom. 

Innuendo aside, it was a pretty straightforward process. I had to cut a succession of steps, one to hold the outside of the steel burrs I had, and one to hold the little adjuster bar that was from the bottom of the old mill. In the middle of all this, I ordered a better boring bar from littlemachineshop.com (which I love, because they always have good quality import tools), which made the second side and the cap a lot easier. 

Then, a minor disaster: I wanted to hurry up and finish, so I was rushing through cutting the cap out. Got the initial work done, but my parting blade wasn’t cooperating, so I decided to cut it with my band saw and then face it. My parting is pretty bad, I usually have to face the parts after anyway. Facing means making a cut perpendicular to the axis of rotation, on the end of the spinning part, often to clean up a cut made some other way. 

So I take it out of the lathe, put it in the vice, and start cutting it with the saw. The band saw is balky and doesn’t like the 2” round. Rushing, not getting things in position, etc. Also, at this point, it’s midnight, so I’m tired and making dumb mistakes. The blade pops out, I put it back in, keep sawing. finally, the part comes off.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1398/IMG_4100.jpg)

I take it back over to the lathe and start to cut. It’s really rough; almost immediately, the part snags, and because I’m only holding the thin side, it’s ripped out of the jaws, and ends up in the chip tray (the metal that comes off from machining operations is called chips; the chip tray collects some of them; much of machining is dealing with chips).  The part is bent, ruined. I give up for the night.

The next day, on lunch, I start cutting on a new lid. I have just enough material, and at least the drilling parts of the work only take maybe 20 minutes. That evening, I get the boring and parting done, flip it, carefully true it up, and face it off without incident. 

Then, finally, I was ready to assemble it. I was a little surprised that it went together on the first try. Everything fit; all my measurements had been within tolerance, and after a quick washing, I loaded it up with pepper. Works great, doubles as a bludgeon. Very tough. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1398/IMG_4098.jpg)

The next day (today, the day I’m writing this, I looked at the simple nut on the top, and decided it would be better if it were a bigger sort of knob (the technical term is “thumb nut”), that could be operated without tools. So I went back down to the lathe and made one in about 25 miuntes. And that’s the grinder we have now. Hopefully I won’t break this one, but if I do, I can fix it.

I walked in and there was Cyrus, chillin'' at the bar with a new ''dew. I actually like the new hair better, even though it is a little funny to see Cyrus in a crew cut. I laughed, I admit it.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >For example: Reaghan.</span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/start_with_ladies''_night/1214/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />We were the two drunks at the end of the bar solving the world''s problems. We came to the conclusion that people are better taken individually than in groups- there''s some context missing, but that''s what I remembered hung over this morning. That and a lot of pretty girls. Which brings me to the next part of the story. (You people reading this should realize that this narrative has a pretty good basis in fact, but I''m glossing over the boring parts of the evening).<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Then Cyrus upstaged all this knuckle writing by doing his whole forearm.</span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/start_with_ladies''_night/1214/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />New girl comes over, Jordan, we meet, get to talking, and it turns out she wants to be a Suicide Girl, but needs a photographer. I was, of course, doing my normal thing, taking drunkpictures at the bar, and so she asked me if I would do it, and me being an idiot, a sucker for a pretty lady, I said sure. So it''s me and Cyrus and her hanging out and drinking, and one thing leads to another, and they''re kind of talking, and then I look over and they''re making out. Making out pictures don''t do anything for me, but I snap a few anyway, because the impulse to document is still there.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Like I said, making out pictures don''t do anything for me, but I love her surprised smile in this picture.</span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/start_with_ladies''_night/1214/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />So I turn to Rachel, who was sitting at out table, and say something, chit chat like, and then Jordan says "Matt!" and pulls up her shirt. Reflexes and impulses being what they are, I snapped a couple frames. Demand all you want, but I''m not going to post that on the internet unless she tells me to, which is unlikely.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >Does this look like a girl who would flash the camera for fun and profit?

Her name was Kat, I''m pretty sure, and I remember her asking about my camera earlier in the night. Maybe I''ll run into her again. If not, it''s the bus theory of meeting women.

Completely transform an office waiting room into a lounge/dance floor/art space for the duration of the party. We brought in rugs and cushions, projectors, lights, big fabric hanging bits, art from previous iterations of the party, and a dozen or so cool people.

There was also the matter of the music; [DJ OTHA](https://www.instagram.com/othamusic/) (also known as Joseph, the man in the fetching hat) spun like a 4 hour set after opener [Vizlicious](https://www.instagram.com/vizlicious/).

There was a photographer, who shall remain nameless to protect the innocent, who''s work really demonstrates all that''s wrong with the world right now. <br /><br />The photographer that brought up all these questions is a very successful commercial photographer. Very polished, styled images. There are a lot of things that I don''t like about them. A lot of his images are super low contrast, with no blacks (tonality, not people) at all, while also cropping off body parts willy-nilly. His lighting also bothers me- the photos strike me as the kind you need an army of assistants (well, at least two or three) to maintain-complex and unnatural.

This was one of those nights that it was just such a privilege to be there. Picking up the camera and using it opens strange and wonderful doors, and this was one of them. Marisa, founder of Third Wall, above and below, is a total rock star, someone I know through Odd Salon, and puts on this thing. I had little to no idea what it was, but saw on facebook they were hoping to get someone to come and take some still pictures, and someone to take some video, and I was happy to volunteer.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1503/0001.jpg)

Marisa is a real rock star, incredible voice and energy, trained as an operatic voice if I recall correctly. It was her show, her idea, although this was the first one they''d had since 2019. The same family that hosted the last one was hosting this one, but they had since moved house. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1503/0003.jpg)

Anyway. The idea was: back in the day a lot of music happened in ''salons'' with live players, sometimes even the composers themselves, demoing new ideas, fragments, etc. And everybody had a whole cultural context in which the pieces were experienced; they knew the history of the players and the composers, who was sleeping with who, who studied with who else, etc etc. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1503/0004.jpg)

So what Third Wall events are is introducing some of that context with the music played by people that also know that history. The theme for this one was "Unrequited," about, you guessed it, unrequited love. Really, a fascinating way to spend an evening. I don''t know when the next one will be but they have an [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thirdwallmusic/).

I never used to worry about repeating myself, because I thought it wasn''t possible to take the same photograph more than once, in a "can''t step in the same river twice" kind of way. Even two photos taken very close to the same time and same place will be different by infinitesimal details, and in those details, I thought, there would be enough difference to fill up a lifetime of photography.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1536/0002.jpg)

There''s definitely a part of me that recognizes that, and also sees that even though I have a routine, and do some of the same things over and over again, my approach changes, and in the case of these photos, _I''m a different person_ than I was when I was taking the photos the first year.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1536/0003.jpg)

That last point might seem trite, but it''s worth some emphasis in the light of my last post. The idea that the photographs are a trail of evidence left by the photographer of their own personality, a cryptic map of their psychology. 

> "I am a part of all that I have met; <br> 
Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'' <br>
Gleams that untravell''d world whose margin fades <br>
For ever and forever when I move."

I am affected by what I see, and that feeds back into the pictures. Anyway. I''ll quote Ulysses basically for any reason, love that poem. "Some work of noble note may yet be done, not unbecoming men who strove with gods." I''ve also been reading Moby Dick since last Friday, maybe that''s why I''m thinking of ancient mariners.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1536/0004.jpg)

So for these pictures, this year, I used the new camera, the Nikon Z8, with all my Leica M lenses. There were some growing pains (turns out for non-CPU lenses the Z8''s meter is finicky), but it definitely allowed me to do different things than last year, when I relied mostly on the point-and-shoot Ricoh GRIIIx. I also wasn''t trying super hard to make a record of any one thing, again, just shooting what was interesting at the time. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1536/0005.jpg)

I don''t know about other photographers, but once that pressure is off, I can relax and just make honest pictures. I''m not trying to make any great statements about anything; it''s more a kind of sense making, trying to understand the world by making art about it. Of course now I''m making a post-hoc justification for how I work based on how I feel now, I wasn''t thinking about any of this while I was shooting. Of course, that new understanding will feed back into the work I do from here on, and so maybe I don''t need to worry about repeating myself, still? Let''s not and pretend we never did.

I go back to the processor to turn it on, and there were a couple pieces out of it, so I opened the lid and took a look at the tanks, and the rinse baths were a bit frothy. If you know anything about processors, or about photography in general, It''s not a good thing for your rinse baths to be opaque, and also not a good thing for them to be frothy. The froth turned out to be rinse aid, which is strange and unnecessary, but whatever. I digress. <br /><br />So, I see the processor in this state and I''m a little upset. You''ve got to understand, this is a quarter of a mil sitting there let to rot. Not only that, but the utility of it, its ability to make prints, was seriously degraded. Maybe I''m crazy. But I was a little pissed. So, I tell everyone we really need to drain and clean the machine, and then we can get back to printing, it''ll take a day, but the prints will be better and the machine won''t in danger of breaking down imminently. <br /><br />As background, I''ve worked on these machines before, and I have a pretty intimate understanding of the chemistry involved. If you want, you can look it up, I''m not in the mood to explain it here. There''s no need for the rinse aid in the final baths, because the prints are dired with hot air right away. Which I tried to explain to the office manager (or whatever keith is), but he wasn''t having any of it. By this time I''d been to get cleaning supplies, pulled the rinse bath rollers, and cleaned the first set. I put the machine back together and went outside for a smoke. <br /><br />I''m outside, then, with one of the other people I work with, Haley (not Luna). Keith, the office manager, comes over and starts talking about the machine, and I try to explain to him that really the machine should be thouroughly cleaned once a month, and he goes off on me. Says he just got off the phone with some so-and so from tech support who told him it only needed it every six months, and moreover my experience didn''t matter because I''d never worked on this machine, and I said to him, fine, let''s just let it drop, no reason to be angry. So he yells at me some more, and I tell him to let it go some more, and seemed like about ten times we went back and fourth like that, and finally I tell him, fine, find another photographer. And I turned on my heel and grabbed my shit and I was gone. <br /><br />Since then, I''ve had a pretty chill day. I went to sauced and had some coffee, shot some photos for the 23rd st project (coming soon, next post, I swear), and built a bike for a pretty girl.

I wrote an essay to go with these last night, describing the parade of small indignities that happened while I was in transit, crossing SEVERAL MOUNTAIN RANGES in the time it took to watch a couple movies, but I decided I''ll just keep those to myself. Who cares? I''m here, the thing I was here for went fine today, and I''ve got a week to hang out.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1504/0002.jpg)

Dad was looking at my blog earlier today and he thought there weren''t enough landscapes. I felt OK about that, but also I don''t just take photos of people, so here. A bunch of photos of not-people.

Here is one of the ways doing photography the way I do is worse than just sharing the pictures on instagram on the day: these were photos from Jeff''s birthday gathering over a year ago. Some stuff is timeless and important and some stuff is just friends gathering for nice drinks. I think they also went out to the bar after this but even at this point I wasn''t drinking, so we demured and I think I drove home? Anyway. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1569/0004.jpg)

I probably need a system for like, knowing if something is super important or not, because having year old pics just now getting published is a little embarrassing. On the other hand, at least I''m getting there eventually.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1569/0005.jpg)

I do have a reason for starting to get these out. There''s only so much time, and dying with thousands of unpublished photos couldn''t be me. No sir. No Vivian Maier here.

That little snake voice, the one that says “You don’t matter, your feeble attempts at art making mean nothing, they’re bad anyway,” is an emotion I know all too well. You don’t toil at a thing in relative obscurity for as long as I have without having those thoughts. It’s really part of why I can be so shy when I’m out with the camera; it’s easy to think that what I’m doing doesn’t matter and I shouldn’t bother people with it.

The workshop I went to last October had one of the questions aimed at this, sort of. The last day, the fifth question was: If today was your last 24 hours on earth, you’re leaving on a space capsule, and you only get to take with you the pictures you take now, what do you take? Now after we’d done the exercises, we were talking about the uses of the questions, and I asked, “How often are you doing ‘last 24’?” Sara, the instructor, said without hesitation,“All the time.”

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1281/8D54EF27-A160-482D-9628-D0235DD13461.jpeg)

And if you think about it, it kinda makes sense: all the time, it could be your last 24 hours to make art, to look and see, and be in the world. So to be thinking, is what I’m doing important enough to take with me? If it is, then dammit, there’s room for me to be here making it. Somewhere, probably instagram, I saw a poem that included the line “You are allowed to occupy space,” and that’s maybe something I didn’t always feel entitled to? It’s true, though: even though the world doesn’t always want to give it to you, it’s OK to be here and do your thing.

yeah, just like the title says. Putting the pictures first in the post, as a stopgap to putting them first in the design. Going to start playing around with sizes and arrangements pretty soon. Need a Visual Heirarchy, some differentiation between text types and sizes, some good colors, etc. Good does not have to be a thousand line CSS file. I’m hoping for like a hundred? Anyway, not a lot to say today. Trouble sleeping the last few nights, already took a melatonin to try to knock myself out. 

I might do some truly egregious things here before the design settles. Accents. Background colors. Who knows?

This was a great party. It had everything: a pitch deck for a sci-fi show, kimonos, live bands, a pot of soup (maybe it was chili?), hand drawn illustrations, comics, and photos by yours truly. On the walls, that is. Also I shot some pictures too. Ahkil (above, center) knows how to throw ''em.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1513/0011.jpg)

While I was there, everybody who had brought an art that wasn''t performance got to get up and say a few words. I said: "My photos are mostly about being in the right place at the right time. Perfection only lasts a moment. Anyway I''m glad to be here with you all right now." I can''t think of a better way to sum up my work. Right place, right time. Serendipity by another name. Or maybe it''s finding what here and now is the right place and time for? Mostly it''s just a matter of looking and seeing.

Some people would have had a day like this, taken one or two group selfies, posted them to instagram, and called it a day. I, on the other hand, took maybe a hundred pictures, waited six months, made selects from them, let them sit another two months, killed the duds (photos that just don''t work for whatever reason), did proper toning and exposure adjustment on the rest, and then now I’m posting them to my own damn web site. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1514/0001.jpg)

Instagram is not my friend and it’s probably not yours either; this site, to steal a line from my friend Robin, “… doesn’t collect any information about you or your reading. It aspires to the speed and privacy of the written page.” That’s why it’s fast, despite using the biggest images I can get away with. There’s no bullshit loading that you don’t see. Anyway. Here are some nice pictures from a lovely day in the park with friends, sometime last year.

Some people might say, matt, why you gotta go so hard, and to them I say: I don''t know any other way to be. If I''m gonna do something, I''m gonna do the thing. I picked up the camera when I was fourteen and I''ve been taking pictures seriously ever since.

these happen every week, I just happen to go to them much less often. you might think ''matt, these are serious draw-ers to go and do this every week'' and you couldn''t be more wrong. some of them are very good at their own style and have a lot of ability, I would never describe it as a serious endeavor. more like a social hour with some strongly encouraged creativity.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1548/0005.jpg)

Each week, there''s a sheet that goes around as people arrive, and everyone writes down at least one thing to draw; things like ''mystery liquids'' or ''how math makes you feel'' or ''feelin puffy''.  I personally am pretty bad at drawing, but it''s fun to try to think of something within my abilities to fulfill the prompts. 


# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1548/0006.jpg)

Also, and this can''t be overstated, everyone there is just really rad? like encouraging and nice and strange in the best ways. Kawan, Kevin, Akhil, Auguste, uh... everyone else who''s names I don''t know or remember because my mind is like a collander that doesn''t hold names until I''ve heard them 50 times or can look them up online... 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1548/0004.jpg)

This one was the first night I had my new-ish 105 1.4 for the Z. Technically it''s for an F mount, but with the FTZ adapter it''s great on my Z too. I think all of these were with it? Snappy focus, very shallow depth of field, but sharp as hell too. Really dig this lens. It also helps that I figured out some of the AF on the Z8; letting face detect do its thing is super helpful most of the time. It even works in manual focus if you set the camera right, who knew?


# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1548/0009.jpg)

I went in to see the woman singing at one point, and the person singing was just puring their heart into it. Just really emoting to a room of like, 10 people, only half of whom were watching. I took a few photos, and showed them to Kawan; he said something along the lines of "How did you see that? I was just there standing next to you, and I didn''t see that." I mean, part of it is the lens for sure, but part of it is choosing the right moments. And, not to toot my own horn too much, but I''ve been doing this in some capacity for more than a quarter century at this point. If I couldn''t pull a rabbit out of my hat at least some of the time, it''d be time to hang that hat up. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1548/0003.jpg)

Speaking of rabbits out of hats... I need to go to bed. I should figure out how to do these during the day, maybe I''d find that easier? When I''m not so exhausted? Nah, I always write best when I''m fighting to stay awake. It''s like a natural deadline, just means I have to push a bit.

so somehow, these photos from 2022 driftwood went missing and didn''t get developed with the rest. When I had the film run for last year (2023) I threw in a bunch of random rolls that had been sitting around for quite a while (some for over a decade), and these were in there. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1537/0019.jpg)

in any case, I''m working on the rest of those pictures, the ones from the most recent driftwood. Trying to decided if I should tell my internal critic to shove it and just publish a 30-picture edit. Maybe. Maybe another day of staring at the grid will let me cut another couple, and really shake out a nice 15-picture edit.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1537/0020.jpg)

see, this is why I need to work with a photo editor on San Pablo. I''ve got a big edit of about 500 and a closer edit of about 150, and this is really where the rubber meets the book sequencing. Figuring out what goes where and how it all fits toghether is a whole thing by itself. For my first two books, I did it my self, over the course of months. Big stacks of work prints. Actually the first book kind of sequenced itself, just fell into place like magic. The second one was harder, and this one is going to be even more so, because it''s also shot over a longer time period. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1537/0021.jpg)

These are from a trip up to Portland January 2024; we went up to see our friends Sam and Kate. I know I said the Driftwood pics were soon, but they''re not quite ready. I need to show them to some people before I can let them out the door. Anyway, this trip.  

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1570/0002.jpg)

The air from the plane was, for some reason, super clear; it feels like it''s never this good. I took a bunch of photos out of the window on the way, and really liked this one. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1570/0003.jpg)

I''m also not at all sure where the light in this photo was coming from. Maybe the city? Maybe another city, like Sac? No idea.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1570/0004.jpg)

It was supposed to be a nice and simple little weekend jaunt. Go up, drink some wine, eat delicious food, and fly home. We got there, and it started snowing over night; by 10 in the morning the power had gone out and the whole city was basically shut down. We had cheese and crackers and wrapped ourselves in blankets, trying not to freeze. Sam made Caccio e Pepe for dinner, and I realized I was _starving_. I had been reading Moby Dick all day, got through the first lowering, and that''s where I still am in that book. Somehow, reading it while stuck in on a cold winter''s day was right, and since then the mood hasn''t struck me. I do love that if you just read the first several chapters, it''s a buddy comedy between Ishmael and Queequeg. Nothing bad could happen to our buddies, right?

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1570/0005.jpg)

Anyway. The power came on in the night and the house warmed up; we were all able to shower and charge our devices back to full when we woke up in the morning. Then we went wine tasting in downtown Portland. Neat place, big Burgundies.  All the waiters could do this neat trick with the stacked glasses that apparently everyone that comes in has to get a picture of. Yes, I am also guilty.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1570/0006.jpg)

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1570/0007.jpg)

And then that night, I decided to walk a little bit around the neighborhood. I think I was nominally searching for an open store to sell me a soda or gatorade, but really it was a little cabin fever and a need to move around a bit. Hard to sit still.

So this was early in the process. If we’re all Wile E. Coyote, running off a cliff, this was the moment the ground was no longer there, but nobody had yet noticed. For reference, we’re now in free fall, hoping the shovel we’re holding will buy us some time (we = the USA, and the poorly coordinated response). Couldn’t just pay people to stay home for 6 weeks and wear masks when we go out for groceries, could we? That would be to easy. I’m not shouting. You’re shouting. No, you calm down. 

I mean, we pay farmers not to grow food to control markets; this is exactly the same thing (except that people are also starving).  

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1372/9BD80B4D-8135-4900-96B2-1F425B17E95A.jpeg)

Anyway. I was doing a lot of walks in the first part of the lockdown. Solo, and with Sophie. I posted some of the pictures at the time, right when I migrated to this new blogging software and redesigned everything.

I have a lot of stuff I’d like to work on, not sure which direction to go in. There’s a new bag design I’m kicking around, a bit of a riff on the Domke J series satchels (with better closure, organization, and most of all, rain-proofing). There’s the ever present bike work, but I’m waiting on materials to come in for the fixture, and also I need the lathe to cut the tubing.

There’s also a couple book projects to work on; I want to take all the dinner club photos I took over the years and make a little chapbook. I also feel like the San Pablo stuff is coming to a close. I don’t know if it’s in a place that’s good or done but I know I’m not feeling like working on it any more. The world has moved on, and it’s time for some other project. So I’ll be working on an edit for that, to see if there’s enough to make something out of or if I just file it away for further work later. We’ll see.

This was what, three weeks ago? getting dangerously close to the fluid present, in any case. Sophie was out of town this weekend, off to do work things on the east coast, and I had a weekend free to do whatever I wanted. I realized it would be a perfect time to do a quick overnight in the sierras, see what Yosemite had to offer. I had a new camera to break in and get used to, and time to burn. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1522/0012.jpg)

So after brunch and a stop for gallon jugs of water, I started driving east. There are a couple ways to get out there, the northern route on 120, which takes you to tioga pass and switchebacks down to the valley proper or the southern route, which goes through Merced to 140. I was headed for some campgrounds on 140 that are first-come first-serve, hoping to get lucky. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1522/0013.jpg)

And, as luck would have it, there was one tiny spot open at the first campground I stopped at. Just big enough for my little two person tent and a chair, basically. I got my tent set up and went down to the river to put my feet in the water. I sat there and read my book, there being no cell signal, for maybe an hour, and then got up to go back to the tent and sit there and watch the clouds.  

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1522/0014.jpg)

Unfortunately, instead of being high and pretty and harmless, they were a storm coming in. I rushed to get the fly on the tent and hopped inside. Then I had to get back out and re-tie the fly down to bigger rocks; the wind was gusting to maybe 30mph in the canyon, just wild. I sat in the noise of the wind and the rain, waited for it to blow out. Just sitting, alone, in the middle of the storm, can''t see out of the tent because the rain fly went all the way to the ground. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1522/0015.jpg)

Got up in pretty bad shape, as my ground pad wasn''t holding air; made some coffee and some breakfast. Freeze dried biscuits and gravy, which is actually really palatable. Drove for a half an hour and I was in the park. Walked around, saw some things. Took a bus to a trailhead, hiked up to mirror lake, which is neither mirrored nor a lake; really a wide spot in Tenaya Creek. A nice hike though, with options that kind of get you away from the crowds.

Then, after a quick stop to buy gummy bears (the best gummy bears in the world are hte ones in the gift shop in Yosemite National Park, I don''t know how they do it, it''s some local confectioner), I drove home.

As of the 28th, I’ll be back at Weedmaps, doing backend Elixir again. I’m really stoked to be working there again, and also working from home (not commuting!) again. The BART really is a drag.</p> <p>Another item: I’ve finished the bag I’ve been working on for friend Grant, and that’ll go to him. I think I need a different fabric for the liner, the sailcloth I’m using is a little too stiff. I think I want to do one in Dyneema, although it’s eye-wateringly expensive.</p> <p>The bag is a sort of collage of features I’ve liked from many bags, along with a few things of my own invention. I have a lot of bags, and they’re all good for one reason or another, but they all also fall short for reasons, too. I’ve done some modifications to some of them, and use those bags the most; the only unmodified bag I use regularly is the Think Tank Retrospective 7, which is great, but not perfect.</p> <p>The outer pockets are similar to a couple different designs; they were originally patterned after the ones on ReLoad bags, but now they’ve morphed into something way closer to what’s on my Domke J-803. Inside, there are organizer pockets for pens, flashlights, a multi-tool slot, and camera batteries, or similar sized items, and also room for smaller items frequently used (I keep my spare phone battery and sunglasses in these, for example).</p> <p>Inside the bag, there’s about 1000 cubic inches, or about 17 liters of space. There’s a strip of velcro positioned to take Domke inserts for camera stuff, or anything else backed with velcro hooks. There’s also a built-in laptop sleeve which I think still needs refinement. It’s possible I’ll do my own without any padding, and use an external sleeve. It’s more about having a place to keep the machine than needing extra padding there all the time, as I don’t always carry my laptop.</p> <p>Finally, on the back, there’s a big flat document pocket, for things like airline tickets and magazines and whatnot. I only seem to use that pocket in airports.</p> <p>The closure of the bag is lifted from the EDC series of bags by Adam Savage, although now that I know about it I’m seeing it all over, including in bags I already own (a craftsman toolbag from college-era; many backpacks seem to have them too). It’s a sort of doctor’s bag opening, where the edges of the bag are held in place by two pieces of steel wire. The top opens very wide, and gives easy access to the interior. The zipper I’m using is a waterproof YKK #10 in black.</p> <p>Handles and straps are all tubular webbing, 1” for the top handles, and 2” for the shoulder. I find with a wide enough strap that doesn’t bunch up, I don’t ever need a shoulder pad. The shoulder strap also uses a cam-buckle for adjustment, like all the good messenger bags (except chrome, who have their seatbelt thing). This quick adjustment means it can go from being a casual over the shoulder bag to a secure cross body bag super easily. If you bike a lot, it’s really nice.</p> <p>And that’s it. That’s most of the bag. I could talk a lot more about it, but I’m already over my limit for how late I’m up and how many words are here.

yeah. So two weeks ago, we went camping for the second time in the Pandemic, this time with a couple friends, Cason and Ryan. We picked a spot up in the sierras, where there was a lake nearby that we thought we’d be able to swim in. Unfortunately, that didn’t work out; the lake was a bit gross, with a lot of foulness from various fowl. But, as luck would have it, there was another place to get in the water, in the river we’d crossed twice to get up to the campsite; we’d noticed it and the people there on the way in, so we decided to check it out. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1374/0002.jpg)
# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1374/0003.jpg)

As you might be able to tell from the pictures, it was really great. Access was a little difficult, I can’t imagine getting down to the water if I was only on one leg, but then again I managed a lot on one leg there for a while, so who knows? Anyway, there was a large local contingent, but we kept a good medium distance most of the time, and figured it was outside so it was probably good enough. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1374/0004.jpg)
# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1374/0005.jpg)

So, we get home, everything is fine, I develop and scan all the film and post the photos to facebook, because that’s primarily where our friends who came with us are, and for some reason that’s just where I went with them first. On that post, I wrote: 

> Photos from the weekend camping trip. Mostly from the river. Ryan, Cason, Sophia, and a few others that I don’t have links to on here. I know travel is dangerous right now, and I could be an unwitting hazard for others; this was managed with as little close contact and going inside of buildings as possible. Probably as much risk going to the grocery store, spread over a weekend. Distance maintained from the people not in our camp; masks when needed (always when inside). 
>
> Honestly? The absolute best thing to do is still to just stay home.  But I don’t think that’s sustainable even in the medium term; it’s the same line they give you in abstinence based sex ed, and look how well that works. Our government has completely failed us, and we’re not going to get any relief until 2021 at least (vaccine, new government). So, in the interim, we’ve gotta figure out how to live in this world, manage the risks, and not go crazy trying.

And then, of course, five days later, I get a fever and body aches and I start to wonder if my luck has finally run out. I quarantined in our spare room, and slept most of tuesday; started to feel better that evening, made crappy scans of a bunch of negatives with my phone, and felt mostly better wednesday. I still took the day off, because I was still kinda tired, slept, and also just frankly worried I might be dying. I went and got a rapid COVID test, which was negative, and was insanely relieved. I then spent a while worrying about false negatives, but as it turns out the test I took is about as good as the slower tests. Why aren’t we rolling those out everywhere, instead of having people wait days and days? I don’t know.

Anyway, yeah. Moral of the story is probably “Don’t Panic.” Or maybe this is another one of my stories without any point, that I just felt like telling. maybe I needed a lot of text to excuse posting a lot of photos with this one.

A lot of the time, moving through the world, I just think, like, oh, that''s interesting, take a single frame, and move on. It''s one of my worst/best habits, because really I end up with like, pictures of fences and random signs and things that aren''t part of any story. Also, a single frame is almost never the photo. Or at least the first one isn''t. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1529/0002.jpg)

I may have talked about this before, but there''s this thing called ''working the subject'' where you take one picture, move around, take several more, different compositions, points of focus, and really nail down what attracted you to take the picture in the first place. If you think of photography as asking questions, this is the first one: why did I want to take a picture of _that_?

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1529/0003.jpg)

But/and, I also find it natural and normal to work this way; take a moment, compose a single photo, get it, and move on. I don''t think either way of working is less valid, but I do know the overall quality of my work goes up when I work a subject a little. That''s the way I see it, anyway. There''s a braggadocio school that says you should only need one shot, but we can dispense with the macho bullshit, just between you and me, right? Like, maybe someone is good enough to get it in one. Or maybe they stopped at one and just have no idea where a little exploration would have taken them.   

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1529/0004.jpg)

Really, for me, it''s a bad habit I learned early on, when I only had one roll of film at a time, or one a week to shoot. Film was expensive, processing was also expensive, at least until I discovered the magic of the 11-reel developing can in college. That and bulk rolling black and white film changed everything. Not worrying about running out was incredibly freeing. But sometimes I still fall back into that scarcity mindset.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1529/0005.jpg)

It''s not film or even hard drive space that''s scarce these days, but my time. Do I have time to pause and take 20 photos of an unpainted picket fence? Probably; at 4.5 frames a second (max speed for the Leica), that''s less than 5 seconds. Really working, though, it''s closer to two minutes.  It might not be 20 photos, but 10 wouldn''t be out of the question. When I intellectualize it, think about it and put it into words, it doesn''t sound like much at all. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1529/0006.jpg)

Of course, I don''t work with words when I make pictures, and there''s the rub. I''m just feeling my way through all this. The scarcity mindset is a trauma response of sorts; doesn''t just go away. I''m not a psych, so I don''t know what to do with that, other than keep shooting and try to remember that there''s plenty of time and space for what I need to do.

Is Robert Adams still alive? ([He is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Adams_(photographer))) Driving along the front range on I-25, I could really see the attraction to the area, which was and really still is his home turf. It''s spectacular in scale, and the juxtaposition of the tiny scale of the ''development'' done here next to the mountains that _do not care_ is sublime; it is a ratio that is just out of our ability to understand.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1382/big_empty_0002.jpg)

The impulse persists, though. to try to put a frame around it, even (especially) at 70MPH. The smaller, man-made junk on these rises that go on for miles and miles; the smoke from the fires. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1382/big_empty_0003.jpg)

I dunno. We''re out here. We came to get away from the smoke in CA, and there''s a huge fire (biggest in state history) about 5 miles from where we were staying for the last month. The prevailing wind was sometimes in our favor, sometimes not. We were isolating/social distancing in a house owned by a friend of the family; they had a dog that needed watching, and their dates and ours aligned pretty well. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1382/big_empty_0004.jpg)

We were already coming to Colorado to celebrate Sophie''s birthday. It''s a big one, and even in the pandemic, we figured we could get away with a small gathering, as long as everyone is isolating properly before (we''re also going to all get tested before we meet, as an additional precaution). Then, of course, we''re going to go back to Cali and sit in our house and isolate for two weeks; followed by the regular social distance / pods we were doing before. It''s not zero risk, but it''s also not a ton more than sitting at home (by my reckoning; I am not an immunologist, please carefully consider your options and risk factors). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1382/big_empty_0005.jpg)

I still have complicated feels, even doing all the right things. I guess it''s like any form of security. It''s not a binary, but rather a continuum. My personal threat model for this is "don''t kill anybody" and second "try not to die." Mask wearing is non-optional in public settings; private gatherings are small, intentional, and book ended by long periods (at least two weeks) of social distancing. We''re following all the rules, or at least as many as we can and still do the thing. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1382/big_empty_0006.jpg)

We also spent the first month of lockdown not entering a building not our own house. As we found out about mask wearing, got sufficient masks that fit well enough, we added the grocery store to that list. And I''ve blogged about going camping up in the hills, after that even. Going into a store, as long as everyone is masked, seems decently safe. You won''t catch me going inside a bar or restaurant until this is really over. Isolation in time and space, and try not to die. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1382/big_empty_0007.jpg)

That''s it for now. We''re away from the smoke, finally, in an airbnb. I should be sleeping. good night.

It was delightful and weird those are maybe my two favorite qualities.</p> <p>The highlight of the evening was the unveiling of Savage’s machine. “Like everything I do, it didn’t work until the last minute,” he said. Or something like that; I’m sure the whole thing will be up on <a href="http://tested.com">tested.com</a> eventually. First, he rode it on the milk crate seat, then, realizing it would hold his weight, he jumped on top and pedaled it from there. There was a nice Q&amp;A period, and then everyone dispersed into the night.</p> <p>Sidenote: every time I think the color balance is too hard, I should just put it away and look again after getting some sleep. It’s almost always exaustion, and not the color, that’s the problem.</p>

I was going to stay home and nap today, but fate threw a good excuse to go walk around the mission for an hour today (double masked and keeping my distance from everyone, naturally). It’s been a while since I was out in the world. Five thousand steps according to my watch. Maybe the longest I’ve walked in a year? It’s been a while. I kinda wish I’d gone further. I used to do 10 or 15 miles in a day, no problem. [Solvitur Ambulando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvitur_ambulando), I’ve always thought. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1389/3AB2BBD1-669D-489A-9F49-98B59DAD032D.jpeg)

The Mission was much as it always was; rumors of a dead san francisco are greatly exaggerated. Valencia had a couple blocks closed off, and a lot of the restaurants had ‘outdoor seating’ with varying degrees of ‘outdoor’ for each of them in the unused parking spaces. None were the fully enclosed spots like I’ve seen in photos from other cities, but I’m still not about to sit down that close to other people. I kept walking. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1389/6FE09778-FFCD-4D5A-8411-3DF423D428B2.jpeg)

Trying to work on the backlog of tasks, but these pictures were fresh, and I kinda like them. Getting out the superwide was a good choice; something to break up the monotony of the 50mm which I love, and won’t ever really be done with, but/and I definitely needed to take the wide view today. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1389/22B57D2B-9D34-4BD1-92EE-8378A11E9E88.jpeg)

The pandemic is about to enter its second year here. The early days were hard; not knowing what was safe and what wasn’t; it was maybe a month into things before the CDC was recommending mask wearing? We were worried enough that we wiped down our groceries, because nobody knew if fomite transmission was a thing (and we all suddenly knew that word). People figured out new things to do; I figured out recipes to try to relieve the boredom, we had movie sundays, where several households would start a movie at the same time, and we’d chat on discord. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1389/8F8728E1-5C1A-4C4C-BBC7-91BBFD299770.jpeg)

Then, people started figuring out ways to see each other somewhat safely. Abstinence is a bad model for public health, and the good news is we _could_ meet outside, in a park, with six feet between households. Lots of people picked up new hobbies; bread baking, cooking, netflix watching. I re-did this web site, kept fucking up my ankle, my knee, and finding myself unable to walk for periods of days, and hobbling around a lot. I guess that’s what happens when you cut off physical therapy too soon after surgery, but what was I going to do? Go, and breathe someone else’s air for an hour twice a week? No thank you. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1389/D01F5753-6E77-4C32-B47B-E71105E5CA0A.jpeg)

anyway, at this point, we’ve figured out what’s permissible and what isn’t. Stuff outside, with the six feet rule, is fine (ish). Avoid crowds, though; the more people in an area, the more likely someone is there, spreading the virus but asymptomatic. Don’t go inside someone else’s building, unless they’re in your pod; pods are less than six people. This last is broken a lot, because people have to eat, and grocery stores are full of other people. Even with restricted occupancy, you’re definitely sharing air. If you do ‘break the rules’, self-isolate for two weeks, do not pass go, don’t collect $200.

It was a nice day after a load of crappy ones. Winter has been especially harsh this year. I always get a bit down in January. The holidays aren’t as bad, buoyed as they are (normally) by family and food and giving and receiving presents. It’s not yet spring, but it’s getting warmer.

I make camera bags for the harshest conditions. Walking around a city for 16 hours? 110ºF in the desert? Torrential downpour (anywhere)? In a boat on the way to a deserted island in the middle of the night to look for nesting sea turtles? Yes, and anything else you can throw at them. 

But/and, that toughness is only incidental, a by-product of using good [materials](https://mills.studio/materials) and decent sewing technique (good seaming, gusseting, layering, etc). The real killer feature of our bags is that your stuff is available almost instantly. There''s no substitute for having the camera already in your hand, but not having layers of garbage in the way, or needing to store it in a way that''s not ready to shoot are all detrimental. Open the flap, grab the camera, press the button. That should be it. 

The same goes for the other stuff in the bag. Nothing is ballast, ideally. Careful organization means it''s possible to carry a very dense, small satchel with everything you need, available _right now_. This is why I''ve been put so much work and thought into the Small Object Organizer, to help eliminate some of the confusion that happens in the exterior pockets of bags so often. Normal pen slots are just a flat piece of fabric; the SOO is made to fit the dimensions of what you''re putting in it; so pens get a loop that fits them without distorting; the Leatherman gets a three-dimensional leatherman sized slot, and so on. 

We offer several basic shapes: The Small One, mk 1 and 2, depending on how much you need room for small objects (I prefer the 2, but I use smaller lenses). The Businessman''s lunch, which is a briefcase style satchel. The Half Moon, if you have endless small things to organize. The classic Messenger, if you need to haul a lot of stuff for some reason (I use mine for longer bike rides, or when I need to carry a layer and lunch and extra water). Most of the shapes can be scaled down or up to fit requirements; I tend to design around what kind of computer I want to carry, and then work outward from there; what camera system, what lenses, etc. 

First, you have to decide: What do you need to carry? What shape will work the best for the environment you''ll be working in? Does it need to blend in, fade, or look impressive? Does it need to fit in a certain size envelope (airplane restrictions, low key getting into places, etc)? Does it need to match your outfit? These are all things I take into consideration when I''m making a bag.

The start of the bag can be rather formulaic; I know I want it to come out to be about AxBxC inches, and so it’s a lot of working backwards from there to the pieces I need, working out the angles, adding seam allowances where they’re needed, plus a little margin for error. But/And, I also end up doing that thing that anybody that makes stuff does, and throw out 2/3rds of the plan in the middle to improve on the design as I put it together. So you don’t end up with exactly what was patterned, like it came out of any of a thousand high quality sewing studios; instead, you get the best possible iteration of that bag, starting from a good idea and continually improved over the course of making it. That’s why instead of an hour or two to cut, and 3-4 to sew, I’ll spend ~20 hours assembling a bag. It’s worth it, in my estimation.

A couple weeks ago, to celebrate being fully vaccinated, I took a couple days off of work to do some stuff I haven’t been doing because of the pandemic. A couple of weeks prior, I was idly playing with the map to see what destinations were within a day’s drive, and I realized that yosemite was only three and a half hour’s drive, totally doable in a long day. Get up at 5am, drive in and get there by 10, hike around in the valley during the day, catch sunset from Tunnel View, and drive back. Home by midnight.

<div class="caption">This tree photo is a little deceptive; the rock wall in the background is maybe a mile away, and at least a couple thousand feet tall. Watch for devious trees.</div>

The day before, I realized it would be a lot better if I had a travelling companion. I find that when I go places completely alone, I don’t make as much of an effort. Like, nobody will know, right? But with someone there, anyone, it provides a little extra pressure to actually _do_ the thing. There’s a term for this in ADHD circles, ‘body doubling’, which I do not like, but it’s a thing. Anyway, I texted a bunch of folks (ok, 3) and my friend Damaris was available and said yes. Damaris is great. She came with not just with the gentle pressure of her presence, but with her own enthusiasm for the trip, and a boatload of knowledge about the plants and animals in the park. Maybe that enthusiasm is a normal thing on a day trip to one of the most beautiful places on earth, but it was appreciated none the less.

So, that thursday morning, I got up superfuckingearly, at a time that reasonable people don’t even consider, showered, made a coffee, and grabbed all my kit. I took both my nikon and the leica, a tripod, the 50 summicron and a 300mm nikkor which I shot with basically all day on each camera. I also had the voightlander 15 and the 35 in the bag, for the leica. But first, there was a lot of driving.

First, up to [redacted] to pick up Damaris, then back, 580 over the coast range, getting spit out at Altamont into the central valley, where the course always meanders a bit, briefly touching the 5, then to some other road, then finally to 120, just following the map. Apparently the 120 pass wasn’t open but the entrance to the park there was. There was 1 car in front of ours paying to enter; no line at all really.

<div class="caption">Somehow, this is getting closer.</div>

<div class="caption">This was as far as I made it last time I was in the park, september 2019. I was re-learning to walk at the time.</div>

We stopped at the first turn off that had a view of the valley. There was a view of Half Dome over the rise, but it was a little too hazy to result in a good photo; I could have turned it black and white and jacked up the contrast, but I decided against it. After the fact, of course; in the moment, I snapped a few photos, hand-held, and we moved on; the real action, so to speak, was further in.

<div class="caption">One of the few spots I busted out the 15mm. Rectilinear get rekt.</div>

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1409/L1005574.jpg)

‘the real action’ was a traffic jam and a stop for facilities; where we stopped, like everywhere else in the valley, was covered up in beautiful views; we walked out to the river, and took photos. There’s not a bad place to stop in the whole park.

Since I had skipped breakfast, and it was getting on towards lunch, our next stop was to eat. Limited concessions were open, but that included a fresh baked pizza for each of us. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1409/MAM_3733.jpg)

Once fed, we hit the gift shop, as it was right there. The best gummy bears in the world are the ones in Yosemite, so I always stop and get some. Then, we drove a little ways back up the valley, to the trail that leads to the base of Yosemite Falls. Calling it a hike and a trail is a little grandiose; a nice stroll, with a little scrambling over wet rocks at one end, if you want. The last time I was in the park, even that was a bit too much; I was just post ankle surgery (remember #anklewatch?). I’ve subtracted surgery recovery but added gouty arthritis, which I’m getting treated but doesn’t go away over night.

Anyway, after the falls, I noticed the clouds were building, and there was a chance that they’d cover everything up before sunset, so we decided discretion was the better part of valor, and got in the car and drove up to Tunnel View, with the sun in the right part of the sky (behind us) to get some really spectacular light. The clouds kept shifting and changing, and I climbed up above the tunnel, so I could basically sit there and watch things develop. I say ‘climbed’ but really it was some light scrambling on rock. 5.5 on YDS, I’d say, maybe a 5.6 moment in there.

At that point, I’d done all I’d set out to do for the day, and then some. So, we got in the car and headed homeward.I think next time, I''m gonna take a pad and do some bouldering.

Still photos from last fall. We arrived in Colorado, where my mother in law lives, and stayed there for the night; an added benefit of going there is we were able to pod up with her and Sophie got to spend some time with her mom. The next day, we moved into the empty house we were watching, and met the dog and cat we were taking care of. The house was nice; spacious, big yard, nice kitchen. There was an amount of smoke, but the park right next to the house was usually tolerable, and really quite nice in terms of a big open space to have easy access to.

I got a new lens this week, the Mitakon 50mm f/0.95. It''s a superspeed lens that has a very large aperture, allowing a lot of light in. I think it''s probably on the level of the first 1.0 noctilux in terms of bokeh and sharpness (having shot not at all with the leica lens, and not much with this one yet). It took me several hours over the last few days to get the lens calibrated; there''s an adjustment for the rangefinder coupling that''s done with shims, and there''s also a somewhat fiddly adjustment to get it to go to infinity; after a lot of messing around, it''s finally dialed in. I might do a video about the adjustment, as much to record it for myself as for, like, the rest of the world. I''m definitely going to do some more thorough review of the lens, because it''s new and shiny and I''ll definitely have opinions after a month with it.

Sophie got an appointment three weeks ago, to get her shot, so we went into the city and did the thing. Quick, efficient, nice. I was pretty much done with work for the day, so went with her to see what the city was like. I''ve worked in and around this area for years at a time, so it was interesting to see it so empty on a Friday afternoon. Not that it was a ghost town, but it was maybe 20% of what I would see there any time between 2013 and 2020 on any given day.

The area around the entrances and exits was a little busier, but nothing compared to the middle of Salesforce or Oracle or one of those events. Just a constant trickle of people coming into the huge building, and another trickle of them leaving. Some SF parking authority people directing traffic, and volunteers outside, directing people. It was really cool how normal and functional it all seemed. Is this something we can expect from government services? shit that just works?

I have to agree with some of the people I''ve seen with _takes_ on twitter, that once people have a sample of free healthcare they''re going to want it all the time. It makes so much sense from so many angles, not least of which is the human angle: more, better care for people that need it the most.

The last post, I forgot to explain: I''d been posting pictures from last fall, but then I imported a bunch more recent things, and ended up working them up instead of continuing. This blog has been fully nonlinear for a while though, and I didn''t think it merited more than a passing remark, and then I forgot to even put that in the text. So here it is.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1407/0020.jpg)

Tomorrow, I go to get my second shot. I''m pretty happy to be getting it, both because I''m tired of being reasonable and because it provides more coverage for people that can''t get it. Tired of being reasonable like: Sacramento is halfway to a lot of fun things in the Sierras, and since I have to go there anyway to get stabbed, I might as well go on to the mountains, catch the sunset, hang out, and then drive home later at night. But. The reasonable thing is, of course, to come directly home. But. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1407/0021.jpg)

I think what''s going to happen is I''ll get my shot, come home, maybe go to the fabric store, and save the day trip to the sierras until I''m fully covered in two weeks. a little more planning will net me a lot more trip, anyway. Speaking of net, it''s time I went to sleep. Enjoy the rest of the pix.

"You should blog more," the windmills told me. Not really, I''m not [Tony Pierce](http://www.tonypierce.com/2002/3/escalator/3.htm). But I should. There''s a huge mountain of backlog again, although somehow I''ve been posting some of it and not removing it from at least some of the stashes I have around; big, loose edits I generally do when I import stuff, so it gets synced to lightroom cloud. So it''s a bunch of work to figure out what''s been posted, but I know these haven''t, I just shot them yesterday. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1419/0002.jpg)

Speaking of lightroom and clouds, there''s a new feature in lightroom''s selective edits panel, that lets you magically select the sky. It made editing these a ton easier, lemme tell you.

I shot these while we were ill-advisedly driving on Dec 23rd, christmas'' eve eve. 12 hours for what is normally an eight hour drive; we were going to fly home, but tickets were super expensive; we started looking at nearby airports and included socal, so there we were, chasing a $600 discount. Should have just flown, losing a day and gas and hotel at both ends and it''s pretty much a wash. at least I got some good pictures? Sophie drove while it was light, and I drove in the dark. Her night vision is great, and it makes her nervous when I shoot and drive, so it works out. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1419/0004.jpg)

What else? we''re in OKC for xmas and a few days. Not seeing many people because COVID OMICRON, and the people we do see will be seen outside. Both of us are at three shots and a recent case of delta, so probably at peak immunity for this wave anyway. Not that means much, but layered on all the caution we can muster while still living our lives? I think it stands as reasonable.

Sorry for the typos, I''ve been up since two timezones ago yesterday morning and only got 4 hours of sleep in the hotel last night for unfun reasons. I really wish there was a way to know when you''re booking online if the beds are actually comfy? like I don''t care about most amenities, but that would be nice. I''m not asking for a [Kluft](https://kluftmattress.com/royal_sovereign/) (one of which I tried, after asking the matress salesperson his favorite; I almost fell asleep on it instantly, as if it was drugged; for $20k it better come with drugs). A decently up to date holiday inn has a fine bed that I can sleep many hours on. Not last night.

At least today was pretty easy, brain-wise. just had to be in the right places at the right time, not take off my mask on any planes, not even for the lovely in flight coca-cola, which is somehow better than other coke. Just up and down and out, a little light reading, a little _Train to Busan_ which I''ll probably finish watching tomorrow. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1419/0007.jpg)

I did enjoy driving this time, though. Even though the conditions after the sun went down were pretty bad. It was raining the whole time I was driving basically, real downpour for a lot of it, lots of traffic. Not the worst driving conditions or the worst traffic on an interstate in the middle of nowhere, but both were top 5 for sure. I like situations like that though, it''s just you and the road really, and a place you''ve got to get to. Mind wanders, and you think about old stuff and new stuff; how towns are settled or how boundary conditions affect mask sealing or whatever comes to mind. It''s like being a little high? but also not at all high, because if you stop concentrating on the important things at all, you die?

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1419/0008.jpg)

I think it''s sort of because the stuff that''s at the forefront is so rote, the background thoughts are more noticable? or possibly it''s the shower thought phenomenon, where there''s a bunch of white noise and other sensory input, and it''s feeding the creative background machine somehow? I don''t know. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1419/0009.jpg)

I''ve babbled enough, and I need sleep. I might come back and try to knock this into something more sensible tomorrow.

I took photos with the Ricoh accidentally in jpeg for the first half, realized my error for the darker parts, but the noise is still pretty crunchy after the sun went down.

I think the San Pablo project is over, or at least dormant; I think about it now in the past tense, and the best ideas I''ve had for the work in the last while was to do something else, branched off from the set of rules that was the project, more or less. I don''t think I''ve got a book''s worth of photos; I don''t even know if I''ve got a small gallery show. I need to sort of take a look and see what there is.

This was a night where we went out to get burgers, at a place called Al''s that google tells me is still in business. I found out earlier today the bowling alley, Albany Bowl, is closed. This was almost two years ago, so I''m not super surprised. The whole deal with bowling is being inside, and there''s not a lot of that going around. At least restaurants were able to do takeout/delivery and go less into debt staying open.

Anyway, still working through the backlog. I''m bouncing around a bit because there are actually several backlogs, as it turns out, with photos from lots of different things that happened, that I edited and then sat on, for whatever reason. They''re good photos, Bront, so I''m going to go ahead and put them here. That''s what blogs are for.

This was also mid-september, around when my parents were here. The second one is a stitched pano, from two images. At least I’m not committing the sin of HDR.</p> <p>There <em>are</em> some problems with sunsets. First of all, they’re cliché. Like, forever and ever. Second, they’re the sort of thing anyone can look at and take a picture of that works. You look at a thousand of them, and there’s this dull sameness that’s like looking at glitter. Pretty, but not, you know, rising to the task of making <em>art</em> most of the time. (note here that I’m talking about my personal definition of art and artmaking, you do you boo).</p> <p>BUT. There’s definitely a part of me that thinks all of that is bullshit, and shoots sunsets anyway (sometimes just on my phone, trying to pretend I’m not serious about it). Cliche? That’s just something a jaded person says because they can’t admit something can be nice without being impossibly niche and unheard-of.</p> <p>AND. “A picture anyone could take.” But no, not anyone did; I was there. I chose this exposure, this framing. I chose a place to stand and took the picture just when the sun hit the top of the clouds. Every picture, moment to moment, place to place, is unique. Sometimes all I want to say with a photo is: “This is where I was, and this is what I saw.” It’s not enough to be taken seriously in some circles, but I’m fine with that. Not every picture is the cover of NatGeo or the New York Times; none of these, I suspect, will ever hang on a gallery wall.</p> <p>Anyway, it’s a complex subject and I’ve just barely scratched the surface. There are probably much more interesting photos to be made (my favorite of these is definitely the first one, which is not really a sunset picture). Maybe I should learn the lesson of the photography workshop I just went to and limit myself to one picture? I do need to be doing tighter edits in general.

Walked from one district in Tokyo to another, through the old Imperial gardens (I think; The big park between Shinjuku and Shibuya). This was the first part of that walk; the gardens get their own post.</p> <p>I have to admire people like <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/sms_publishing/">Craig</a> <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/">Mod</a> (second link is to his walking newsletter) who not only walk much farther than I do, but who can distill a day into a single image. I’m not sure I could, even if you held a gun to my head. Or maybe I could, and I’m being lazy? This is the internet tho, world of infinite bandwidth, and people like more pictures. There’s something very haute and designer-y about only putting out what you want to, and not what people ask for. It’s saying, ‘I know better than the people that want a lot of photos,’ and the damming thing is it might be right.</p> <p>Speaking of walking: I’ve had a string of bad luck with my right ankle, stemming from an injury all the way back in 2003, when I was a college freshman. I got what I thought was a bad sprain, was off it for 6 weeks or so, and then thought nothing of it again. Then, a couple weeks ago, while walking around at the bouldering gym, I rolled it a little and it hurt a bit and swelled up a little, so I iced it and babied it for maybe a week, and it seemed to be better.</p> <p>Then the Mormons went and had their open house; probably more walking than I’ve done at a stretch in quite a while. The next day, I had to drive back from the south bay for [unrelated]. Driving is a load-bearing exercise, and it kinda made it worse, such that when I got back I went immediately to the first clinic I found with an X-ray, to see what kind of damage I’d done. They were largely useless, didn’t even send me home with a splint.</p> <p>So I went to Webster Ortho Urgent Care. They were great; really from beginning to end great care. Shot some more X-rays, assessed the joint by hand, and then went over the films with me about what they were seeing. Apparently, the old injury probably wasn’t just a sprain; from 16 years later, it’s difficult to tell, of course, but the way my bones had grown indicated something might be wrong. So later this week I’m getting an MRI and a consult with a surgeon, and maybe my ankle will be stabilized after all this.</p> <p>Right now, I’m confined to a walking boot, as tolerated, which isn’t a ton. Mostly sat around all weekend. It’s possible the 10000mph summer has gone down a couple orders of magnitude, which kinda sucks. When your body says slow down this clearly though, it’s really imperative to listen.</p> <p><span style="display:block;" class="center"> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/wandering_last_day_in_tokyo/155/0001.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/wandering_last_day_in_tokyo/155/0002.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/wandering_last_day_in_tokyo/155/0003.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/wandering_last_day_in_tokyo/155/0004.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/wandering_last_day_in_tokyo/155/0005.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/wandering_last_day_in_tokyo/155/0006.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/wandering_last_day_in_tokyo/155/0007.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> </span></p>', '2020-04-04 21:01:24', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'wandering_last_day_in_tokyo', '2019-06-03 05:38:22', 1, false, NULL, false, '{wandering_last_day_in_tokyo}');

The whole thing was like they’d seen the inside of an Olive Garden once, described it to their designer, and said “Go nuts on it.” Faux aging paint jobs, fake marble, tile floors, the whole deal, but executed with this precision and workmanship that made it kind of alien?</p> <p>One thing I like about visiting foreign lands is looking for the standards. Not just the shape of their outlets but the distance between them, are they grounded or GFCI by default. What materials do they use as standard? What are the bathroom fixtures made of? Doors? Locks? Lighting is interesting because it’s always different, affected by the local fire codes. Local brands of everything made to different specifications, not only the difference between inch and metric, but what do they consider a sufficient width, of say, scotch tape? Endlessly fascinating minutiae. Japan was great for that because even now a great deal of what they use is made there.</p> <p>Anyway, after the weird mall, we walked down to this area with a lovely view, and took pictures. The Gundam was on the way to the pier near the statue of liberty; that photo is a composite of 6 or 8 images. I didn’t have the wide angle on when the people were there, so I got it in sections and stitched it together in Lightroom. Not sure what the golden cigar is about. Then we found a bunch of street food that would have at least been tastier than the mall food, but alas we had already eaten. I think I got a Pocari because I couldn’t get enough of that stuff.</p> <p>Then we went to Akihabara in search of electronics components, but it seemed like all the shops were just selling used cameras and computers. Interesting, and not bad prices, but not at all what I was hoping for. Apparently you can hire a guide to get you in the good shops, but unless you know exactly what you’re looking for, it’s hard.

The former was on Patreon, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/davidalanharvey/posts">David Alan Harvey’s page</a>; he was talking about his work that was keeping him close to home. The other was in Craig Mod’s newsletter <a href="https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/016/">Ridgeline #16</a>, the bit about Robert Caro. He worked for 5 years, thinking that was a lot, and then met fellow writers that had been working, seriously, for much longer, which made him realize it was totally fine to be where he was doing what he was doing. The lack of outward progress wasn’t an indicator of failure. Some things are not incrementally successful.</p> <p>Which tells me that maybe I’m wrong about PROJECT SAN PABLO. It’s not a code name, I just like it in all caps. There’s something to be said for chipping away at something for many years. It’s not done. It won’t be done for a while. It’s yet to be seen if it’s ‘doable’ but it’s something that I can do other things and still have as a going concern, a subprocess, maybe.</p> <p>Also I bought a new lens.

So, it’s on ebay, along with the summicron. Oh well.</p> <p>I’m a little bummed about it, but really the kind of images it’s good at making aren’t really what I want to be doing. I mean, look at this post: Side-on photos of people in the train, one slightly blurry portrait, and a couple static scenes. I want to be making good portraits. That’s not to say the Leica isn’t a good portrait camera, but it doesn’t work that way for me.</p> <p><span style="display:block;" class="center"> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/shortly_before_japan/170/0001.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/shortly_before_japan/170/0002.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/shortly_before_japan/170/0003.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/shortly_before_japan/170/0004.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> </span></p>', '2020-04-04 21:02:08', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'shortly_before_japan', '2019-04-09 08:29:30', 1, false, NULL, false, '{shortly_before_japan}');

The thing that’s missing is the thing that animates any long term reportage: people. I mean, there are lots of traces and things, but the people that make San Pablo actually interesting are who I need to get after. I was thinking something like a survey of all the independent businesses on the street, from the piano dealer to the Dead Fish. That could be really interesting, and it would give it a focus that it didn’t have before. Even inside that, I may have to be somewhat selective; it’s 22 miles of road, which doesn’t seem like a lot, but it is.</p> <p>I should probably start with a list of businesses, huh? Or maybe I drive up and down and write down names of places. There’s no database where I can type in street and ‘not a chain’ and get a decent answer, is there? Hmm.</p> <p>I’m also thinking about picking up another electronics project, maybe a laptop or another watch. I feel like I might be able to scratch the laptop-specific itch by just buying a GPD pocket or iPad pro. Not sure. Watches are hard, though too; a lot more constraint on power and space. So I dunno. So far I’ve downloaded datasheets for a system on module for the laptop, decided that 8gb of ram might just be enough, and drawn a little diagram in my notebook. The idea being something that is really portable, but with a good mechanical keyboard, in the vein of the Tandy 100, or more recently the <a href="https://mntmn.com/reform/">MNT Reform</a>.

I did a little shooting this weekend with the Fuji again, and it was a lot easier to work with. I think actually the thing that made it easier is autofocus. Call me lazy, but I think it’s actually faster than I can focus. When I was younger, I could almost always beat the AF, but maybe I’ve lost a step, or the talent has atrophied. Either way, here I am. People move around a lot, and also they are often closer than 2.5 feet from the camera, and I noticed that too. I took three lenses and only used one, the 35mm ‘Fujicron,’ which is a 50mm full frame equivalent (roughly ~52.5mmE, but who’s counting?).

It’s in one of the most heavily photographed areas of San Francisco, and there were tons of other people around shooting video and stills and posting them to whatever social network. It’s been months, and the strike is won. That out of the way…</p> <p>So in the last post I was like “yadda yadda no major site updates here’s some photos” but I realized I didn’t say way that was, or what might be preventing me from actually doing those updates. And instead of just going to edit that post, I figured I could just throw up another post instead.</p> <p>So, the reason the whole blog redesign/replatform isn’t happening yet is that I’m working on several other projects and I also am back to work, which means during the day, I’m workin’ for the man. The first project, and definitely the one I’m most excited about, is the tiny laptop. I’m making a laptop in a roughly 4.5”x9” footprint, to serve as a travel machine. I’ve got some of the parts inbound and some more of them already here. Also, there’s the solar light project that I’m working on for a friend. Not sure how much of that is under wraps, but it’s a thing, and I have a raft of browser tabs open and I’m working on parts in Kicad.</p> <p>Finally, there’s the bag venture, which is still a thing. I’m looking at Dyneema fabrics for the next one, which will be a similar style to the last one, but I’m also waiting for the fabric to be in stock. I’ve got a whole bolt of Codura in black, I’ll probably do something with that also.</p> <p>Fun times. Things are happening here at Mills Studios. Not a lot of them photographic, although all that work is also ongoing; I may have my first lead on a portrait subject for PROJECT SAN PABLO. I need to come up with another photo project to work on in the interim, since that’s kind of stalled out. Something will come to me, it always does.</p> <p><span style="display:block;" class="center"> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/palace_hotel_strike/173/0001.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/palace_hotel_strike/173/0002.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/palace_hotel_strike/173/0003.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/palace_hotel_strike/173/0004.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> </span></p>', '2020-04-04 21:02:11', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'palace_hotel_strike', '2019-03-14 07:56:00', 1, false, NULL, false, '{palace_hotel_strike}');

Been a bit of a rough start to the year, but here I am, finally getting into a rhythm, maybe. Been thinking about this blog a lot, what it could be, what I use it for, all that.</p> <p>Over on his blog, Ventakesh Rao has been <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/01/31/elderblog-sutra-1/">taking on</a> the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/05/elderblog-sutra-2/">topic</a> at <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/11/elderblog-sutra-3/">some length</a>. That is, what are blogs now that the game of blogging has been thoroughly explored? His idea of ‘elderblog’ is interesting, but I’m not sure what to make of it. I’m a practical person; I don’t know if meta-games are really what is in it for me.</p> <p><a href="http://warrenellis.ltd/">Warren Ellis is blogging again, too</a>. In his newsletter, he talked about how on twitter, there was no room to be wrong, to experiment; as a not very public figure, I can say for sure I’m wrong on twitter all the time, but I see what he means about the playfulness of it being gone. There’s a freedom that I need in the practice of writing things down and sharing them that all the socials don’t have. I turned off auto-tweeting of posts for a while, and I’m unsure if I turned it back on or not. I’m not going to go look, either.</p> <p>But/and, I do have some ideas for what to do with this to keep it fresh beyond more content (so much content waiting in my queue, I haven’t even finished the Japan photos yet). I liked the slideshow idea that I did, it just needs some more work; also, I need to really invest some time in making the pictures scale with whatever screen is looking at them. They’re currently sized to be a little big on my smallest screen, the 12” macbook, but that makes them tiny and anemic on big screens. We have the technology. We can rebuild them. Or, at least, make the photos look good for everyone.</p> <p>What I would really like is something that was as easy to post from as instagram, but I could either post short things from my phone or longer things from the computer when I wanted. The little photo essays I’ve been doing on insta have been doing well; it’s just that it’s still somebody else’s playground. What it needs to be is a self-hosted instance of something compatible with masto, so people can federate your stuff into their timeline easily, maybe? So when you come to my page, you get the blog format, but you sub to the feed and you get your preferred client interpretation? that might work… like a one-click install and you’re up on heroku or something.</p> <p>Dunno. Just some ideas.</p> <p>(I accidentally used one of the pictures meant for this; just imagine it here instead of there) <span style="display:block;" class="center"> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/the_bear_at_the_ferry_building/175/0002.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/the_bear_at_the_ferry_building/175/0003.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/the_bear_at_the_ferry_building/175/0004.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/the_bear_at_the_ferry_building/175/0005.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> </span></p>', '2020-04-04 21:02:13', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'the_bear_at_the_ferry_building', '2019-02-21 08:19:59', 1, false, NULL, false, '{the_bear_at_the_ferry_building}');

Hopefully I’ve sorted the ordering; editing this way, over ssh, I have to publish the post before I can see.</p> <p><span style="display:block;" class="center"> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/33861094470_cf310fc6b8_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/34114734681_c6d6024d82_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/33434779373_78077a17e0_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/34088213222_e6409d8e51_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/33861090380_7ced49db39_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/34114733901_bcdc7c4cb8_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/33861092810_28acc23bcd_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/33861103010_3ac28fe24c_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/34114730021_43ca153aaa_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/34114731831_6bba2f2a94_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/34088206362_6e92e5011f_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/33861089280_5c09478a2a_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/33861095680_670593d7cb_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/34244949235_afec06cb4c_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/beach_walk_roatan/302/33861107900_bbb100429c_o.jpg" alt="Beach walk roatan" /> <span class="caption"></span> </span></p>', '2020-04-04 21:07:31', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'beach_walk_roatan', '2017-04-24 17:10:23', 1, false, NULL, false, '{beach_walk_roatan}');

The only real difference this time was the lettering on the signs was half in a new language (most signs are in English and Japanese).</p> <p>We met Nicholas after we got out of customs and picked up our hotspot gadget (which is why I have internet here hurtling through the countryside on this train). Then we made our way to the train station, picked up our rail passes, and waited. We had some beers while waiting on the train to toast our arrival. The party was together.</p> <p>I tried to get photos out of the train window, but nothing worked. I think it was probably a combination of being up far too long on too little sleep, and the fact that the trains here are really fast. I ended up with a couple I don’t hate, anyway.</p> <p>Then we had to walk from the station to our hotel. It took us a good 15 minutes just to find our way out of the station, and then we wandered back in to a different part, got lost again, then finally mad our way out to the surface and to the road we needed. During all of that, I was juggling luggage and camera, and managed to lose the new viewfinder for my 15mm. of course I didn’t bring the old one as a backup, so I’ll have to pick up another one of those when I’m back in the states.</p> <p>So, after getting to the hotel, showering, and getting some yakitori for dinner, I went looking for the thing, retracing my steps, but didn’t find it.

Not just any camera store, but easily the best one I’ve been to here in the bay area: Looking Glass Photo, over just off San Pablo. The Fuji reps were there, hanging out with a pile of cameras and lenses for people to play with. They even had the GFX, the new medium format (some part of me dies, calling something less than 6x4.5 medium format, but I digress). So, I got to play with the X-Pro, which was another frontrunner for my next camera, and decided that waiting 6 months and paying triple the price really wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be. So I bought it.</p> <p>I’m still getting used to the camera, and this isn’t really a review, jut my initial impressions. The important stuff: AF is a bazillion times faster than the old model, but still not quite as fast as my nikon D750. Whatever, it doesn’t need to be; it’s sufficient. There’s very little shutter lag; I don’t have any kind of test rig but haven’t had any problems. The files are great, probably two stops better than the old xpro; the highlights drop off a little faster than my nikon, at least subjectively.</p> <p>The viewfinder is just wide enough to show the edges of the 14mm framelines, although with my glasses on I can’t see the edges. Luckily, the live view is a little narrower and there’s enough eye-relief that it works. Lag is down to almost imperceptible levels; the old camera would make me motion sick if I used it in live view in a car, but this one is fine. Also, the picture-in-frame focus aid is really quite good.</p> <p>The bad: the wifi doesn’t support downloading of raw files; you have to convert them in camera and then it’ll read them. I seem to keep knocking off settings by accidentally pressing buttons, although the basics seem to stay in place. I’m also not used to it at all, so it’s very possible this is my fault.</p> <p>Sunday, instead of my usual sit-around-the-house-and-watch-cartoons, I went out for a photo walk, and the weather cooperated and gave me lots of nice clouds and clear air. It was rainy in Oakland, so I headed for the mission, where the sun was shining and it was also raining– SF, where the microclimates have microclimates. I decided to fight my natural urge to walk downhill and headed up 21st street, towards Twin Peaks (the park, not the bar). About a mile and a half uphill from there, I called a lyft to get me the rest of the way up; I didn’t want to get there and be completely blown out.</p> <p>I did a first pass edit in the camera, but I ended up going back to the raw files for this post; the final images aren’t that different, but I feel better about them.</p> <p><span style="display:block;" class="center"> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0001.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0002.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0003.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0004.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0005.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0006.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0007.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0008.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0009.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0010.jpg" alt="" />  <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0011.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0012.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0013.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0014.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0015.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2/305/0016.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> </span></p>', '2020-04-04 21:07:47', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2', '2017-03-07 16:11:23', 1, false, NULL, false, '{photo_walk_with_the_new_x-pro2}');

I took a couple pictures with the film camera from a nice overlook, which are still undeveloped, four months later. We proceeded to the visitors’ center for the national monument, which was closed, so I ran around taking photos anyway. Then we lost the light so we went on to dinner and then back to the motel.</p> <p>The next morning, I woke up early and went for a walk. There’s not much left of Bridgeport.

Someone tell me if it’s okay to look. The main thrust of the argument wasn’t just that he was a great admiral that went all that way, but that he also exercised this continual escalation, from one thing to the next in his life, to see how much he could do.</p> <p>You’ll notice I’m slipping towards three weeks of backlog (almost back up to the traditional month) and that means I’m almost back to the place where I feel guilty enough about the size of the backlog that it puts me off blogging because who wants to confront all of those pictures? And all the writing and such that also needs to happen with them? But I’m also in a bit of a slump shooting the last week, not terribly well rested and been missing my walks. So, I don’t have much beyond a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn6gW7PlbuZ/?taken-by=photomattmills">new gimmick</a> to report (put on a super wide rectilinear lens on, and point it straight up). So, all that to say I’m going to keep on putting up images, trying for a post a day.</p> <p>I had some thoughts about this slump I’m having today, too. This is a thing that always happens with a new camera: get the thing, be very excited about it, and go out and make a bunch of good pictures with it over the first couple weeks. I even had a honeymoon period like that with the GoPro (an otherwise not very good camera for the sorts of photos I take), where I really just played with the thing and had fun. Then, about a month in, a slump hits. I can’t maintain that energy forever, and I find myself falling into old patterns of working, which means I don’t get as much energy from shooting, and feel kinda meh about the whole thing.</p> <p>So, the insight I had today was that I need to figure out how to break those patterns of working, see things from new perspectives, etc. I might break out <a href="https://aperture.org/shop/the-photographer-s-playbook-books/"><em>The Photographer’s Playbook</em></a> and have some fun. I also need to start getting up early to shoot more San Pablo. Right now it’s not in a place where it’s a book, except maybe one of those boring art books that go with exhibitions and don’t sell out their first printings. It might be good as individual large prints, and I need to buy some paper to start playing with that too… so!

I shot a combination of from the hip and looking through he viewfinder, but most of these were shot at eye level.</p> <p>Something I’ve heard said a bunch, including on this walk, that isn’t true: color photography lacks emotion. Fuck that. My esteemed colleagues were more or less in agreement, and I was in a too-agreeable mood to summon the proper righteous indignation, but: fuck that. If your photography lacks emotion, you’re not close enough. Get close. Have some Goddamn Feelings about what you’re doing. That will inevitably come through in the work. If you don’t care about what you’re doing, or about the subject at hand, then stop. You need to be entangled with what you’re shooting, you need to be emotionally involved, have some skin in the game. Some things are easy to care about: the sick, the grieving, and the <em>au courant</em>. (A lot of my pictures are really just me shouting “THIS REALLY HAPPENED!!!”). But for, say, the socioeconomic changes in a city, that’s harder to get into, to find the meat of, to see clearly.</p> <p>I suppose, too, that color is just more laborious. Interpretive work in black and white is so pat these days that you can mostly do it with camera settings. Decide on a look, shoot JPEGs, and be done. Interpretive color depends a great deal on serendipity and correctness after the fact. It’s legitimately more work, and I find myself, when I want to be lazy, just converting to black and white (we are now solidly in territory where I am only speaking for myself, and it is decidedly not lazy for other photographers to make their own choice; some people work very hard at black and white, including my shooting companions).</p> <p>So, what is true of color: you have to put in the work.

I don’t know why, but I found these really hard to edit. The color in the location is hard, and I threw my hands up on that and went black and white. But I’m also emotionally invested in this event, I suppose, and I want to do a good job.</p> <p>To that end, I took my hardest-to-use lens, and pitted it against really difficult conditions. It’s a 500mm mirror lens, f/6.3. I was shooting hand held, and it’s a manual focus lens. The focal plane (that is, how much depth of acceptable focus you get) is about 4”, and there’s about a 1/4” difference on the focus ring between 30 and 50 feet. So, about 12 thou, or 1/80th of an inch. I did ok; remember, you’re seeing the good stuff, not the outtakes (there were many). Even so, using that lens forced me to use a very high ISO, which, if I’d been using a lower one, the color may have been more manageable… anyway.</p> <p>The salon was about abandoned things, from children, given up to an orphanage, to a whole island, in NYC, abandoned to nature. Stops include Paris and Angkor, with way stations at Sati (not a place, but an abandoned funeral practice), and Kepler’s best idea that turned out to not be true.

So, the company I work at does volunteering as part of an effort to give back to the community; we’re part of the <a href="https://pledge1percent.org/">Pledge 1%</a> member companies; and we’re trying to do that with time.</p> <p>In two hours, we moved about 12.5 tons of carrots out of those big bins (called macrobins) and into boxes for distribution to individual centers that provide food to those in need. We also moved about 3 tons of pears from macrobins to boxes, for the same reason. The food distribution is run like a farmers’ market, so people can pick and choose what they want to eat. They do it that way so people can have at least some agency in their choices. It’s amazing what giving people a little agency can do for how they feel.</p> <p>The warehouse we were in serves about 40 (38 is the number I remember, but could be more or less) of smaller nutrition-based aid services in the San Francisco and Marin county areas. They move 48 million pounds of food, about 24,000 tons. Volunteers like us contribute 150,000 hours of labor per year, or the equivalent of 70 full time workers; the money they would spend on those workers goes to buying more food. This place is more like a regional warehouse for a grocery store chain than anything else. According to the warehouse manager (our supervisor, anyway), we helped feed 30,000 families.</p> <p>Now, you might be thinking, ‘That’s a lot of people that need food!’ and you’re not wrong. 1 in 4 people in the Bay Area need some kind of assistance; which is wild and crazy and I can’t believe nobody is shouting it from the rooftops. How are we not moved by that? Twenty five fucking percent. For my friends not in the bay area, you’re probably not getting off any easier. Oklahoma, where I grew up, is about 18%, or one in five. Look up your local food bank, they’ll surely have stats for your area, and send ‘em some love in the form of hard currency or time. I give a few dollars here and there to charity, but going and doing work for a while feels a lot better.

This is important, because as you may remember, I wasn’t a huge fan of it the last time; I had a rental last Xmas and ended up sending it back early because I just didn’t click with it. But, then 6 months of shooting with the CLE happened, and also I looked back at that week of shooting, and really decided I liked what shooting a rangefinder did for my photography. So, I consulted the photo gods and took out a chunk of my 401k and did the deed.</p> <p>I have a couple lenses also coming soon, that should make the shooting experience even better: a 50mm f/1.4 Leica Summilux and a 15mm Voightlander Heliar. These were all shot with my only M lens that’s worth having a cover filter on, the 40mm f/1.4 Voightlander. (I have another, the 50mm f/1.2 Canon, but it has a chip out of one of the rear elements, which causes bad veiling flare; it’s basically a sentimental thing I can’t get rid of).</p> <p>So: All those caveats taken as given: I love it. The shutter sound is better than you’ve heard. Recordings online don’t do it justice. In fact, the moment I heard it I knew this was the camera I needed to have. I’m still getting a feel for the machine and getting all the menu stuff dialed in. Auto ISO is hit or miss; there may be a setting for minumum shutter speed I’m missing, but really I don’t mind setting that manually; I’ve never really trusted the auto on any camera (edit: found the setting, still don’t know how much I’ll use it).</p> <p>Sundry: The focusing, viewfinder, and everything else are exactly what you’d expect for just shy of $8k: the best possible. The rapid-fire mode is amusing but I don’t see myself using it too often. The touch screen is OK but not great. It’s not an iPhone, but the double tap to zoom is handy, as is the keyboard, even if it is a little fiddly.</p> <p>I really wish there was a way to copy photos over wifi that didn’t involve the phone; like I was complaining on masto, it would be nice if the card would be available as a shared NFS drive or something like that. It’s a tiny bit of extra software work. I might make a client myself if I can snoop on the traffic between the app and the camera; or even a FUSE driver. I’ll post more later, maybe in a week, after all the wedding photos are posted.</p> <p><span style="display:block;" class="center"> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/m10p_-_second_first_impressions/211/0002.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption">Memorial for Nia Wilson.</span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/m10p_-_second_first_impressions/211/0003.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/m10p_-_second_first_impressions/211/0004.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/m10p_-_second_first_impressions/211/0005.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/m10p_-_second_first_impressions/211/0006.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption">Sophie took this one.

Not to say it was un-organized; the people running the show were quite efficient, actually. It’s a lot of people crammed into a camp made for maybe 2/3rds that number.</p> <p>Everyone is really friendly and there’s good music and the primary activity of the whole trip is being lazy and listening to music. During the day, you can take your floatie to the river, jump in, and float next to the only daytime stage. Get out to re-apply sunscreen, get another beer, and get back in. Repeat until you get hungry, then go to either the mess tent (actually a rather good caterer) or to the town’s only restaurant, which is fine, just diner food. Then, the excitement of the evening begins. You can: dance your face off, then go lay on some cushions in a relaxtion tent, then go to the acoustic stage and sway a little. A lot of walking back and forth, but no worse than any other festival I’ve been to.</p> <p>So: I went this year, with Sophia, and took just a few photos.

There are several good sites out there, <a href="http://onebag.com">onebag.com</a> and the <a href="http://ease.com/~randyj/rjfootls.htm">Backpack Travel Guide</a> being the ones that come to mind immediately. These three share in that they&#8217;re not just a list, but an annotated and in some cases footnoted list, filled with reasons and thoughts on why these things are important. This is my humble addition to that list of lists.</p> <p>Clothes: This is pretty obvious, but it bears retelling: Two sets of clothing (plus on set of spare underwear) is plenty. You can mix and match and be appropriate for almost any occasion, and any more is really just added weight. This includes what I&#8217;m wearing when I leave. <br /> 2 pairs pants- Loose dickies, cotton, but not denim. The same things I wear at home, for the same reasons. They blend in easily, dry fast and are double tough. <br /> 2 T-Shirts &#8211; Black and gray, or black and blue. <br /> 3 boxers &#8211; I&#8217;m a boxers man, now you know. <br /> 3 pairs socks &#8211; Black, smartwool if you can afford it, but I stick to cotton cause I chew through socks too fast anyway. <br /> 3 A shirts (wife beaters, for those at home)- I always wear these. Dunno why, but even in the tropics I feel odd without an undershirt. <br /> Sandals- As much for the shower/tub/pool as anything else. <br /> Shoes- One pair of some kind of fairly resilient walking shoes. You abuse the hell out of your feet on the road, so these will be your best friend. <br /> Rain Jacket- Something to block the wind and keep the wet off of you. <br /> Cardigan/hoodie/sweater- An extra layer, to be added when you need it. Most places, it drops at least twenty degrees at night. Unless it was 90+, you&#8217;ll need it.</p> <p>Equipment:<br /> Laptop- This trip I&#8217;m kind of in a shambles about what laptop to take. All of the software I use is on <span class="caps">OSX</span>, but my macbook is a 17&quot;, not exactly minimalist. A netbook hackintosh would be ideal, but my netbook won&#8217;t do that unfortunately. <br /> Chargers- For everything that takes batteries. The camera, the laptop, the ipod, yada, yada. <br /> Camera- I never go anywhere without it, and this is no exception. <br /> Lenses- I tend to go a little overboard with the lenses. I take four. A 500mm mirror lens, a 35mm wide angle, a 50mm that I shoot 95% of my work with, and a 105 that is really lovely for portraits. <br /> Ipod- might not go this time, as my iphone took a swim last weekend, and I&#8217;m saving all my money for road expenses. <br /> Headphones- Small ones, in-ear. They&#8217;re nice for trains and buses and such, but I don&#8217;t use them anywhere where isolation could be a problem.<br /> Hard Drives, power &#8211; For photos. I generate a massive ammount of photos, and I put them on pocket hard drives, one in each bag. <br /> Card Reader- For copying photos. Faster than plugging in the camera to the computer. <br /> Blower- A gadget I use to keep my camera clean. Looks like a rocket ship. <br /> Flashlight &#8211; Tiny <span class="caps">LED</span> or halogen, I have a couple. <br /> Batteries &#8211; spares for what I carry, namely my camera and the flashlight. <br /> Three way plug adapter (2) &#8211; An ingenious device that makes three outlets from one. Much smaller than a surge protector. <br /> Phone &#8211; Something cheap. Leave the iPhone at home, it&#8217;ll just draw attention in a bad way.</p> <p>Toiletries: I shouldn&#8217;t have to explain these. <br /> Soap<br /> Shampoo<br /> Towel<br /> Q tips<br /> Toothbrush<br /> Toothpaste<br /> Puff<br /> Razor<br /> Deodorant<br /> Nail Clippers<br /> Brush<br /> Glasses<br /> Saline<br /> Contact Case<br /> TP</p> <p>Miscellaneous:</p> <p>Business Cards: for that extra touch of legitimacy. <br /> Cup, bowl, spoon, fork: It&#8217;s much cheaper and usually healthier to make your own meals when possible. I don&#8217;t bother with a full backpacker&#8217;s kitchen, as I tend to stick to cities, but these come in handy. <br /> Sewing kit: Big needles, heavy thread. I end up loaning this out more than I need it myself, but it weighs nothing and takes up little space. Also, if you&#8217;re badly cut and far from a hospital, this can save your ass.<br /> Clothesline, laundry powder: For when you have to wash your clothes in a sink or basin. This is a daily chore, takes about fifteen minutes. <br /> First Aid: Band-aids. Sterile wipes. Aspirin and Immodium. Anything worse, get to a doctor. <br /> Multi-tool: Swiss Army or Leatherman or the like. <br /> Eyeglass screwdriver: Just in case. In the field repairs are tricky at best. <br /> Pocket Dictionary for the Destination country</p> <p>That&#8217;s about it. All of this goes into two bags: a camera bag and a carryon sized backpack. This kit can go anywhere in the world, with a few adjustments for climate in the clothes (more layers if you&#8217;re not going somewhere equatorial), for an indefinite period. Clothes do tend to wear out faster on this schedule; I spent six weeks in mexico with almost this exact setup, and had to trash my shirts and socks at the end of it. I took a much bigger rig to Brazil for my semester abroad and regretted the weight and needed almost none of the extra things.</p>', '2020-04-04 21:56:47', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'the_list', '2010-08-22 00:00:00', 1, false, NULL, false, '{the_list}');

I’ve been walking the same streets a lot lately (which may have been evident by the two posts about the mission, or all the odd salon posts, etc). And there’s a vein in photographic thought that echoes the popular sentiment: that if you’re not doing something new, you’re not doing something worthwhile. St Winogrand said something along the lines of “I never want to take the same picture twice.”</p> <p>So what does going against that guidance get you? Well, the first picture here is one I’ve attempted dozens of times. Not every morning at the train, but many of them. A lot with just my phone camera. They never are quite what I had in mind, but each iteration is closer; there’ll be a cluster of some that kinda work, and then a long fallow period where nothing sticks, and then one like this comes along and just knocks me back. it’s close enough here that I imagine I might be able to pull a print from it that is what I actually want.</p> <p>Fences, alleys: you’ve seen those, too. I’m super curious what the hell Boner Dog was. Now it’s an empty lot, of course, but it looks like there wasn’t ever even a slab in that lot. So what was there?</p> <p>Odd Salon: never predictable, always interesting. The for-real devil came up on stage and drank whiskey at us. Maybe there’s a sameness to the practice that makes me call it the same things, and it feels like I’m shooting the same things, but only in the moment. I always say you can’t tell anything about how good the pictures are in the moment; I think that may apply to this idea of ‘sameness’ that I have in my head, too.</p> <p>The pictures aren’t the same, they can’t be; Everything moves, everything changes. The light is never the same. I always thought re-photography seemed like a gimmick, a little hollow. But the idea of looking for ‘equivalents’, that is, things that are emotionally the same, or at least feel the same, that’s something really interesting.</p> <p><span style="display:block;" class="center"> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/repetition_(again)/221/0001.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/repetition_(again)/221/0002.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/repetition_(again)/221/0003.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/repetition_(again)/221/0004.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/repetition_(again)/221/0005.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/repetition_(again)/221/0006.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> </span></p>', '2020-04-04 21:04:15', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'repetition_(again)', '2018-07-14 06:39:41', 1, false, NULL, false, '{repetition_(again)}');

We camped west of san jose, up in the hills at some county park that chris and angela found. The campground is what’s known as a ‘walk in’, as in you have to haul all your eqipment some distance from the parking lot. It was quite the hill, too. We were camping with the aforementioned brumfelds, and some friends of theirs, I believe journey and Marco? good people, and relaxation was had all around. I figured out how to use a stainless steel water bottle as a waveguide to boost my cell signal, and read a bit more of <em>Death Comes for the Archbishop</em> which is a really lovely book set at a pace altogether orthogonal from what I normally read.</p> <p>Anyway, one of our camping traditions is to stop for pizza at broncho billie’s in niles, when it’s anywhere near the route home. It’s really amazing pizza, a combination of doughy on the inside and crisp on the outside, with generous toppings and sauce. It is, without question, one of my favorite pizzas, but probably also because of the ritual that surrounds it. Coming back from camping, having done the work of breaking camp on coffee and protein bars, we’re always hungry when we get to the place. I always get the Bull Durham, which is every meat topping they have. So good.</p> <p>I’m off this week, in preparation for the new job starting a week from wednesday.

What I meant was it wasn’t meant to be a thorough exercise in putting the camera through it’s paces, but more my first impressions. Now that I’ve had the thing a few weeks, I have more impressions.</p> <p>Especially with the 14mm, it’s a machine made for the street. Discreet, close, quiet. Zone focusing is a cinch, and changing from manual to auto as needed is as simple as pushing the focus ring. I think all of these were hip shot, that is, not looking through the viewfinder, and manual focus.</p> <p>That said, I do have a few gripes: the auto-switch between the eye-level viewfinder and the LCD is still too slow for quick shooting. The buttons on the back, including the little joystick everyone else was so happy about, are really easy to knock and move settings around. More than once I’ve found the camera in some weird drive or focus mode, with the focus point off to one corner.</p> <p>When you shoot a lot with this camera, it gets warm in your hand. I ran down a battery shooting a group of dancers and mariachi band, and it was weird that it got that warm. I mean, pushing around those pixels can’t be easy, but still.

In the end, I decided it was boring and abandoned it, simply because I wasn’t getting close enough to the subject. You can only shoot one or two kinds of pictures from the outside of a construction site. I did a passable job getting photos of the early parts of the construction of the transbay terminal, since that was right on the walk from where casual carpool drops to the office I worked in at the time.</p> <p>No, though, the real problem with the photo essay on cranes is it does nothing to talk about what the cranes mean, in terms of the growth and change of a city; the gentrification of large swaths of the people that have lived there; or the political forces that allow such things to happen. It’s hard to make pictures that are about YIMBY and NIMBY. My take: doubling the density, going from 3 to 6 stories for most residential properties, would be amazing, but only if the city started doing mixed-use zoning again, allowing for ground level retail and restaurants; how are you going to live without a car if you can’t walk a block to the bodega to get a sixer of beer and then a slice from the place next door?

The farm is about 45 minutes east of town, in Sunol. It’s an area of rich rolling alluvium, with lots of small farms and other interesting things that there aren’t room for here in the city. Kathryn is a veteran of the olive oil industry as an award-winning miller. Robin is the author of 2.5 books (counting Scheme as a novella) and is his best self when <a href="http://galleries.notuntitled.com/fat-gold-harvest-web/0053.jpg">slightly annoyed on an overloaded tractor</a>.</p> <p>So they’ve spent the last year working in the grove doing farm things and posting them on their <a href="http://instagram.com/fatgoldoliveoil/">instagram</a>. The instagram feed is mostly Robin, so you get this great enthusiastic novice’s view of the whole enterprise, which has been good for me, a person that didn’t know anything about olives. It’s been interesting to follow along and see the process evolve as they get their footing.</p> <p>Last weekend was the last harvest day, where a bunch of friends of Fat Gold gathered at the grove to harvest some olives and eat good food. While the amateurs worked at one end of the grove, professionals tackled the majority of the work at lightning speed. The amateurs’ process is simple: individual pickers have a belly bucket, and you kind of take a whole branch in one hand, and strip the olives off with the other, dumping them in the bucket. The professional method is basically to cover the ground under a tree in a mesh and shake off all the olives with sticks. It’s faster, but requires coordination and a lot more effort.</p> <p>I helped with the harvest for about an hour, camera over my shoulder, but I sensed I wasn’t getting enough pictures, so I dropped off the bucket back by the barn and switched to just taking pictures, which was really enjoyable, the sort of work I’m made for. Which is to say, the participant observer; do some work, take some pictures, do some more work. I helped a bit with the gleaning, and certainly lifted my share of crates durning the weighing and transfer to the giant macrobins.</p> <p>So this was last weekend, which is record time for me to get a blog post together these days. I can remember waking up with a hangover in someone else’s house and putting together a post, but that was almost a decade ago. As I was there to also photograph for my friends, I hustled and put together a loose edit for them. There is part of me that thinks of this as a client project, and not just personal documentary effort. It doesn’t make much difference in the way I work, but does affect the post-shooting timeline.</p> <p><span style="display:block;" class="center"> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0001.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0002.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0003.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0005.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0006.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0008.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0009.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0012.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0014.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0017.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0018.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0019.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0020.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0022.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0023.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0024.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0026.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0027.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0028.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0034.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0036.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0037.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0038.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0039.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0042.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0044.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0046.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0047.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0049.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0050.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0052.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0055.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/fat_gold_harvest/287/0057.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> </span></p>', '2020-04-04 21:06:38', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'fat_gold_harvest', '2017-11-26 10:22:13', 1, false, NULL, false, '{fat_gold_harvest}');

Albany Steel, real nice guys, they even flame cut my plate with their shear down (it’s been down since november). But, I found out, plate steel is expensive; a single sheet, 4’x8’, is $250. So, I decided that instead of just building one table and having a giant piece of steel that I had no use for hanging around, I’d just build another table, to replace my desk. (Why build one when two is twice the fun?)</p> <p>I’m talking about this a lot because I really like both of these objects I’ve produced. The smaller table is one of my favorite things I’ve ever built, and the bigger one, although not completed, is just really rad too. They’d both hold up roughly an armored car. They also weigh a fuckton; the smaller one is 200lbs, and the larger one is ~350.</p> <p>Anyway, after these are done, I have to catch up on a bunch of non-heavy-construction projects (anyone that does real construction laughs; but for me, this is giant). I’m working on some parts of a technical book with some friends, and hopefully it’ll be out by this xmas. And then there’s another watch project I’m working on, a hopefully python-based smartwatch, sort of in the mold of those big Garmin watches, but with some interesting UI stuff I’ve got going, plus I’m doing all the work for that out in public too.</p> <p>Can’t stop won’t stop forgot how to stop.</p> <p><span style="display:block;" class="center"> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/a_walk_home_in_november_and_a_bee/271/0001.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/a_walk_home_in_november_and_a_bee/271/0002.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/a_walk_home_in_november_and_a_bee/271/0003.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/a_walk_home_in_november_and_a_bee/271/0004.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/a_walk_home_in_november_and_a_bee/271/0005.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/a_walk_home_in_november_and_a_bee/271/0006.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> </span></p>', '2020-04-04 21:05:57', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'a_walk_home_in_november_and_a_bee', '2018-04-05 06:48:00', 1, false, NULL, false, '{a_walk_home_in_november_and_a_bee}');

I was sitting around watching star wars with a friend, and I get a text message from <a href="http://twitter.com/jane4oh5">Kerry</a> that says, "Come to the Speakeasy, bring your camera. Copperheads and Boom Bang." And then another that says ''Really, I''ll pay you.'' I was bored with the whole star wars scene, having watched it approxamately 12 bazillion times as a kid, I still remember all the lines. (yes, I''m a nerd). So I ran home and grabbed my camera and went to the show, which hadn''t even started yet. There were some beers. Remember, I''m supposed to get on a plane early in the morning and fly out to meet all my coworkers in San Fransisco; thinking of this and my empty suitcase, I took it easy on the beers. It was a punk show though, which you can''t really attend without a little drinking. But you know that. So, beers are consumed, and then the copperheads come on and rip through their set like it was talking bad about their mothers. Really fun, fast set. I couldn''t understand any of the words, of course, but that''s not what matters, really. What matters is the noise and the speed and the croud being into it, all jammed up right next to the stage, and the lead singer thrashing around and falling to the floor because so much of his energy is going into the song he can''t even stand because there''s nothing left, and the drummer soaked with sweat and exhausted, and the guitar player jumping up and down and playing as fast as he can to keep up with it all. Either that or we were all a bunch of drunk roaring idiots. Then the Boom Bang came on and solidly kicked some more ass; if the Copperheads were a warm up act, the Boom Bang was a bonfire. I know I use a lot of superlatives, and some of you out there are probably wondering if I''m full of shit or what. I think I just happen to go see stuff at rad moments. I vaguely remember these guys from the last Norman Music Fest I was at, and I wasn''t that impressed. the show at the speakeasy was altogether different.

The truth is, though, for all it’s problems, I really like it.</p> <p>This morning, for no reason I could discern, I woke up at around 6:30, and I could tell that there was light behind the curtains, so I figured right then and there was as good a time as any to take the new rig out for a test ride. (The first photo is from last night, but I liked it enough to leave it in the edit). I pulled on yesterday’s clothes and my boots and went for a walk.</p> <p>I didn’t walk too far before hopping on the 72M bus, which took me north to Albany. I’ve been meaning to go shoot up there for the San Pablo Project. I got to shoot for about an hour. The light was super contrasty, and the camera had a tendency to underexpose that I’m not mad about, really. At the lower end of the ISO spectrum it’s got tons of information before it’s really clipped. Probably an extra stop over the in camera warnings. On the other hand, highlights clip like it’s 2006. I’ll have to do some actual tests if I get a chance, see where this thing actually clips at each end, and calibrate my shooting accordingly.</p> <p>I look at these photos and I can tell right away they’re mine. But there are a couple (the green one with the reflections esp.) that I simply wouldn’t have gotten with a different camera. This thing encourages shooting wide open, something I really miss, and also the focusing mechanism is set up so that it can’t get confused by the near objects in front of you. If you can see it, you can focus on it.</p> <p>Of course, I’ve had an hour with it so far.

I’d just gotten the Fuji, and was super excited to shoot with it. I put 10 or 12 rolls of film through it, and had them souped at a local lab, SF Photoworks. Then, because their scanning prices are just silly, I bought a scanner and started scanning them all in myself. I may have said this before, but I really like the images I get out of this camera. I really don’t like the process of scanning images. The epson software sucks and is slow; the film holders are fiddly and kinda shitty.</p> <p>I’m not sure I’ll keep going in this vein. It’s possible. The newer cameras are a lot easier, which isn’t always a good thing. I see my primary job is to tell stories with the camera; take pictures that at least tell a little part of a story. Sometimes it’s just setting the mood; sometimes it’s something really explicit. Sometimes, it’s telling a joke. The determining factor in this work (among others) is paying attention to what’s happening. Sometimes, if the pictures are easy, I forget and just shoot a bunch without thinking, without knowing what I’m getting.</p> <p>I feel kind of off when I’m doing this, and the main way to break out of it is to change what I’m doing. Change lenses, exposure modes, put my hat on backwards. Tricks and superstition, maybe, but also things that work to get my head back in the viewfinder. Anyway, the limitations of the camera, the fact that it only has 10 exposures on a roll, is fully manual, and large, and slow, actually help push the mental state. It’s like stretching before a run.</p> <p><span style="display:block;" class="center"> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photos_from_the_texas_leica/286/0001.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photos_from_the_texas_leica/286/0002.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photos_from_the_texas_leica/286/0003.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photos_from_the_texas_leica/286/0004.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photos_from_the_texas_leica/286/0005.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photos_from_the_texas_leica/286/0006.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photos_from_the_texas_leica/286/0007.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photos_from_the_texas_leica/286/0008.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photos_from_the_texas_leica/286/0009.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> <img src="https://images.matt.pictures/photos_from_the_texas_leica/286/0010.jpg" alt="" /> <span class="caption"></span> </span></p>', '2020-04-04 21:06:35', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'photos_from_the_texas_leica', '2017-12-09 08:52:56', 1, false, NULL, false, '{photos_from_the_texas_leica}');

Sort of forgot about the whole Instagram thing and just sent them out. Sorry, Edgar and Annie, for blowing up your phones. Then I remembered, and dutifully posted the top one.</p> <p>I’m not sure why I’m so jazzed about these; it may be shooting with a real rangefinder is working for me, or it may be that shooting film agrees with me for some reason, but I suspect it’s neither of those, and mostly that I’m shooting candid portraits again. With the landscapes, with the street pictures, there’s no urgency; they’re pure exercises in form (the objectification and the problems therein are not lost on me; I have read books and written essays on the subject, but I digress). I suppose I shot those kinds of pictures because they were available to me, but I’m not sure it was actually a good direction. Portraits of people, that’s the ticket.</p> <p>So, I’m gonna try to do that more. I spent a long time (the first 10 or so years I was taking pictures) hating on landscapes because I thought they were too easy, that exercises of form were beneath me. I don’t really think that any more; not because they’re harder than I thought, but because I’ve taken enough of them now and found it a good learning experience. A meditation, if you will.

If that sounds terribly boring, please feel free to skip to the end, where there''s a nice picture of Sophie, and also some leaves still on a tree in early December. Those of you that know me know that I am hard on my personal effects. I need durability in everything, and that goes double for what I put my things in. It''s led to something of an obsession with the right bag. What goes in it is usually pretty mundane, but I care about the bag I carry. So, I''ve been known to put down some signifigant coin down on them, or to mark occasions with new bags. For xmas, Sophie''s mom gave me a nice gift card, which I decided would be well spent on a bag I''d been lusting after for a while, the Topo Designs Mountain Bag. First the good: It certainly looks good, all strappy and with oversized, durable zippers. 1000d cordura and lined with some plasticy stuff that seems pretty warterproof, and all the inner seams are at least covered with bias tape of some sort. When I got it, I was pretty happy, as the capacity is just what I was after (officially 1200 cu. in, although probably only 1000 in the main compartment), it''s ambidexterous, and has just the right ammout of organization for me. It comes in a good variety of colors, and is fairly good looking, at least to my eye. Unfortuantely, that''s all the good. It''s like no one field tested the bag at all. The top flap pocket is easy to lose stuff out of: if you put anything small and heavy in there, like a multi tool or a set of allens for your bike, and then flip the flap up, the stuff gets stuck in the little space above the zipper, and will fall out the next time you open it. Luckily, I was still in my living room when this happened to me. Then there''s the shoulder strap. The little tabs at the end for tightening it aren''t long enough, especially if you have gloves on. Then there''s the way the strap hardware is attached, sewn to the bag with a single seam at each end, just a line of heavy stitching. This is not how to secure a strap and have it hold. There are two good ways to do it that I''ve seen: the approach favored by seatbelt makers and the makers of Rucksack, ReLoad, and a host of other bags: to "make a box":http://www.carryology.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/RELoad-Bags-2.jpg on top of the strap where it meets the pack, and then sew an X over the box, or the approach that Domke takes: "sew strap around the entire bag":http://www.wexphotographic.com/webcontent/product_images/large/66/1013942.jpg, so that the pack cloth isn''t holding all the weight. Also, the bottom of the bag is a piece all by itself, just a rectangle on the bottom. It''s two extra seams at the sides taking weight, and two more places for water to leak in, if you should happen to set the bag down somewhere damp. The right way to do this is of course to have one piece that makes a big u: starting from one side at the top, going continuously around to the other. Like "this one my friend Sarah makes":http://martineusa.com/products/oakland-messenger. All that to say that I''m still carrying the bag. Day to day it''s not bad at all. I''m doing my best not to overload it, and to keep it out of the wet. I just don''t expect it to last.

Even with that, we all saved 20 minutes over the traffic jam.</p> <p>Which didn’t really mean anything, by the time we got to our campsite. We still had hours of daylight left. Easiest time setting up I’ve had in a while, since most of the time we leave after work, get stuck in traffic, and get to where we’re going sometime between 10pm and midnight.

I was practicing for my DMV exam on my motorcycle and bumped the throttle; next thing I knew I was in the bushes. I’d love to continue learning to ride when I’m healed, but really, I have too many other things going at once to give riding the attention it needs not to kill me.</p> <p>Other things have happened to shorten the list of projects: I finished the writing machine, which I dubbed the <em>Mosquito Cannon</em> (as in ‘Don’t use a cannon to kill a mosquito’), as it is greatly over engineered for what it does. It’s kind of wonderful for just that reason, though. I assembled v4.5 of the watch, and it’s probably the last version I’ll do, unless something drastic happens. I’ve achieved my goals there; time to move on.</p> <p>That leaves just a few things on my dance card. Photo work, including looking for a printer. The novel in progress, which I may start to serialize. Learning elixir for fun and profit. Getting my leg back up to full strength, as soon as the doc clears me to use it again. And last but not least, getting the new casa organized so we can have folks over. That’s probably a month’s work outside of work. Hopefully some time for blogging in there somewhere.</p> <p>These photos are from some time before Bali; Fletcher asked me if I wanted to go to this show last minute, and I was free, so I went. That little sony kills it when you pay attention to exposure and keep it inside the dynamic range it gives you. It’s maybe as good as my D700 was in decent light, and no slouch in low light either.

I don''t remember why, but I couldn''t take off that afternoon (it may have been before I knew I was changing jobs, and had extra PTO). In any case, Sophie, her mother, and her mom''s friend Sally went on ahead in their tiny Yaris, and I drove the Land Rover by myself, across the central valley and into the mountains. We spent that evening on the patio of our AirBnB, drinking wine and or beer. The next morning, we went to Ernie''s Cafe, something of a local institution. Then we drove around the lake all day. That night, I cooked french fries, and Sophia cooked steaks. For desert, we had wine and conversation. There may have even been a nap in there. This last weekend, I rode a motorcycle for the fist time. It was a range day for the motorcycle safety class I''m taking. Man, that''s a lot of fun. The class starts with the very basics; how to safely start the bike, walk the bike across the range under power in first, feathering the clutch, then short little jumps, then longer jumps, then around the oval; every exercise built on everything I''d learned so far, and by the end of the day I felt pretty good, doing the countersteering exercise. I need to work on looking through the corners, and braking with both brakes. And throttle control. Really, everything. There''s definitely something to motorcycle riding though, beyond the risk involved. Something about the coordination of all the things you have to do-- concentrate on any one and before you know it you''ve messed up somehow. But you focus on none of them, and everything just flows. I''m sure after a bit more parctice, all of that will be second nature and not require Zen concentration. Like driving was at first, so many things to manage. Anything like that is bound to seem complex. Then your left foot learns where neutral is, and your right hand learns where the throttle really kicks in, and the left hand learns how to find the friction zone. Gearheads talk about becoming one with the machine... I thought it was bullshit, but it''s definitely a thing I''ve felt on my bicycle, so it seems natural on a motorcycle too.

And to post more, because as Sophie keeps telling me, people like pictures. <div class="center"> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/new_job_new_commute/358/new-commute-0001.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/new_job_new_commute/358/new-commute-0002.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/new_job_new_commute/358/new-commute-0003.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/new_job_new_commute/358/new-commute-0004.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/new_job_new_commute/358/new-commute-0005.jpg'' /> </div>', '2020-04-04 21:10:10', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'new_job_new_commute', '2015-08-18 17:10:54', 1, false, NULL, false, '{new_job_new_commute}');

A smartass will go print a red/blue text on a color printer, but you get the point: Photographs are not vehicles for truth. They are vehicles for telling stories. The story here: I got on a plane bound for Santa Fe from SFO. I tried to sleep for the first twenty minutes or so of the flight, then resigned myself to being awake, and started looking out the window. I''ve always been addicted to these views, snapping pictures whenever I can see anything at all. This time, it was a bit shocking. Tiny mountain lakes, no snow, and every reservoir has at least a bathtub ring, some that look so wide and have been there so long it''s getting hard to distinguish them from the landscape. All visible from 27,000ft. We landed, and as you could maybe tell from the previous post, Santa Fe has been good. But these pictures need to get out there. maybe next I''ll post my stuff from pride, something upbeat.

A couple nice short posts, and then WHAM, a dozen pictures. These were taken with the rental camera, the tryout weekend. I got to Chris and Angela''s house around 10am, we wer going to hang out, have a picnic and hike a bit. Sophie wasn''t feeling well that morning, but I still wanted to go, and when I got there, they told me to please take as many pictures as I liked of Baxter, so I did. He''s just turning one; at the time of the photos he would have been ten or eleven months at the time of the photos. We had a picnic at an old farmhouse, now run by the state park that owns this section of the coast. There were giant bushes with warrens under them, big old trees, a really good spot. Then, we walked along that coast for a bit. Our destination was a fern grotto on the beach. But first: beautiful windswept beaches where humans aren''t allowed and birds rule. The birds would run forward as the waves receeded and pick at the sand, and then run back up the beach, away from the wave. Walking along cliff, all we could do was look down. When we got to the fern grotto, we rested and snacked while Baxter played with rocks, and then walked back, at which point I was fairly tired. I know this because the photos slow down somewhat. The camera test: As I''ve said already, I''m in love with this camera. The D750 is a really amazing tool. While walking back, I saw a bird flying the opposite direction, towards us. I was able to raise the camera, zoom, and get 3 in focus frames as it passed. It also meant I got the photo of the unicyclist on the cliff. That speed helped a lot when shooting the kid, too. Kids aren''t bird-fast, but they do change constantly, and unlike adults, they''re completely unpredictable. It was also nice to use focal lengths other than 50mm. I may have overused the wide angle end a bit, but it works for some of these. <div class="center"> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0001.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0003.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0005.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0006.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0008.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0009.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0010.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0016.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0011.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0012.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0013.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0014.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test/380/0018.jpg'' /> </div>', '2020-04-04 21:11:07', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test', '2015-03-05 07:58:07', 1, false, NULL, false, '{a_session_with_baxter_or_a_camera_test}');

The first thing we did was get a bite at a little cafe, and then visited the tourist bureau. There was a nice lady there that told us about good places to eat, and gave us a map of wineries on the square, and some coupons for tastings. So, we wandered a bit. The first place we went to talked us into joining a wine club. The two bottles we were thinking about were effectively half price with the club. The tasting room had a bunch of kitschy household goods for sale, handmade by the looks, in addition to the wine. I think _gauche_ is the word, but I may be so backward that shit like that is in style in some circles. The wine was good, and I don''t really regret the wine subscription. It does give us an excuse to go back every few months or so. The second place was more sophisticated, and seemed very proud of it''s italian heritage. They also had a pretty good schpiel about how some of their wines came into being by happy accident. Who knows if it was true, but there was a nice couple also in from the city who shared their salami and crackers with us on the patio as we had a glass. Pretty rad.

Patterns and antipatterns, refactoring to expose complexity (sorry Jacob, for thinking you were crazy when you showed me this before), and even one "miracle of programming":https://github.com/skmetz/socialchorus-dec-2013/tree/miracle.

It''s the same as that feeling when you can''t quite remember the word you''re thinking of. Now, imagine someone came along and showed you how to go over that horizon, and, really, it was just a little hill in your way in the first place. That''s what Sandy did for us, in a nutshell.

She''d also been internetting in search of a solution, and found that the Nevada side of the lake had a weekend county recorders office open, and we could go there to get a license for $50. So, we all got in our cars and drove across the border. We got lucky, in that there was a officiant there; she was doing a ceremony up the hill or something, but she would come back for us in half an hour and do our ceremony for $40. So she did, and we did, and that was that. Here is where the subtitle comes in; I was a bit busy at the time, and so others in the party took pictures with mine and sophie''s cameras, to varying degrees of success. All of the photos of the ceremony were a bit blurry or cutting vital parts of our anatomies, so none of thse are here.

If you''ve been on this kind of bus trip (and who hasn''t?), you know they''re always chronically late, beset by delays, and can be fairly miserable. This was at least well-organized, and well stocked with booze. We set off at the appointed time for what should have been a four hour drive. We immediately hit traffic on the Bay Bridge. Fairly smooth sailing from there to Sacramento or so, with just a case of motion sickness. Then, we started getting into the mountains and the traffic started getting worse. Since it was a bus full of nerds, we all had google maps out the whole way and knew the delay was coming. We drank whiskey and waited, and then, past one checkpoint, we tried to get some guys who were putting on chains for $20 to put them on the bus, and nobody would. So, some of the passengers ended up helping the driver get the chains on to get past the second checkpoint. This all added about 2 hours, plus the stop-and-go traffic the whole time.

I decided to cut all the ones without people about halfway through. It seems sort of arbitrary, but it immediately focused the edit. I used to have a hard rule against photos without people in them. I thought that people were the most interesting thing, and that landscapes and scenic shots were just boring. Of course, I formed that opinion in Oklahoma, where there aren''t really landscapes as such. <div class="center"> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/stinson_beach/486/0001.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/stinson_beach/486/0002.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/stinson_beach/486/0003.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/stinson_beach/486/0004.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/stinson_beach/486/0005.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/stinson_beach/486/0006.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/stinson_beach/486/0007.jpg'' /> </div>', '2020-04-04 21:13:36', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'stinson_beach', '2014-01-16 15:46:15', 1, false, NULL, false, '{stinson_beach}');

I saw a link on the "Adafruit":http://adafruit.com blog about the "Open Source Watch":http://oswatch.org/index.php and knew right away that I wanted to build one. Not just build one, but go one better, make it more extensible, and clean up the rough edges. There''s nothing more personal to me than the watch that I wear; I''ve been wearing one for the better part 25 years, after pestering my mom to buy me one sometime around age 4. It''s not just a status symbol, a beautiful toy; a watch is a hand-hold on reality. It says "This is now," and "It''s only been 5 minutes," and "I really did sleep 5 hours on that plane," and "T-minus 5..." Then there''s the maker''s credo, that you don''t own something until you can hack on it. It''s beyond the skills of a lot of people to do surface mount soldering or board layout or the half dozen other skills required to build a watch for the 21st century. None of it is terribly hard by itself, but it''s all over, different bits of knowledge to cobble together from different parts of the web. Once it''s done and you can program it over bluetooth or plug it into a USB, something wonderful happens. Everyone can hack it. I don''t want a watch for the future, I want a watch for right now. Somthing that gives you a better grip on reality. It says: "You''re here, right now, and this is wh ere you can go." _The author swears this was going to be a dry feature list and blow-by-blow of the design process, but it''s late and he''s feeling inspired -- Ed._ <div class="center"> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/the_scale_of_the_thing/432/0001.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/the_scale_of_the_thing/432/0002.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/the_scale_of_the_thing/432/0003.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/the_scale_of_the_thing/432/0004.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/the_scale_of_the_thing/432/0005.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/the_scale_of_the_thing/432/0006.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/the_scale_of_the_thing/432/0007.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/the_scale_of_the_thing/432/0008.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/the_scale_of_the_thing/432/0009.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/the_scale_of_the_thing/432/0010.jpg'' /> </div>', '2020-04-04 21:12:31', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'the_scale_of_the_thing', '2014-05-20 06:17:12', 1, false, NULL, false, '{the_scale_of_the_thing}');

I rented a camera, to see if I liked it. Instead, I fell in love with the camera, and found a part of myself that I dind''t realize was missing. This is my review of the Nikon D750. It goes like this: I''ve spent over half my life at this point looking through a camera of one kind or another. The camera has always been my way of understanding the world. So, when I said on instagram that "It''s like I''d lost half my vocabulary and now I''ve got it back," I meant exactly that. It''s that feeling of walking into a room and turning a light on, or putting on glasses and suddenly remembering that trees have leaves again. Except, of course, all of the cognitive processes are thing that don''t have words, so it''s hard to even know that they''re gone. Anyway, definitely getting one of these as soon as possible. I''m suddenly bullish on SLRs again. I shot all of these photos on the way home. Every time I see a picture, I can get it with this camera. The weak link in the equation is once again me. Am I too slow? Is the camera set weird? Otherwise, it''s bang on. So, where before I would see a picture and not be able to get to the camera in time, with this, I can get the shot. Realizing this, I see a lot more. The world moves, and I move with it, dancing. The camera isn''t perfect. The shutter button is a hair trigger, so a half press doesn''t feel much different than a full press, but that is probably a matter of getting used to it. The focus modes aren''t super clear, but again, that''s probably a learning experience. There''s noting else to complain about. ISOs up to 8000 are really quite good. The photos here have been pushed another three stops in post. I''d use 12800 without hesitation. The AF is AMAZING. That picture with the birds? I could barely see them, but it nailed it. That''s all, except to say that I''m super stoked to buy one of these, so much so that I''m not going to bother renting the D810 to try. It''s heavier and a touch slower.

I kinda had to, as with the move and everthing, I simply couldn''t afford a new one. I carried my nikon, made a few pictures here and there, and mostly just waited. Then, there was another trip. I knew I wouldn''t be able to do a real trip with just my iphone, a film camera, and a few rolls of film, so I rented another camera, this time the Fuji XT-1. The first couple hours were a complete love-fest. It''s a great little camera, and I do mean little. Smaller than my Xpro by a smidge. The EVF, the main thing I was worried about, wasn''t laggy at all, it seemed, and fine enough to make compositions on. Signifigantly better than the EVF of the Xpro. Also, ergonomically, it''s a slam dunk. I was able to get it up and running in about five minutes of fiddling: turn off auto review, turn off beeping, turn on RAW, forget and then remember to turn off the focus assist light. After a little while, I set up the custom screen setting. There are half a dozen or so things I like to know at a glance; the battery level, the exposure setting and ISO, focus distance, exposure comp, stuff like that. No histograms. No gridlines. Anyway, I shot with the camera over a long weekend. Not enough to really live with it, but long enough to get a feel for it, anyway. When it came down to it, there really wasn''t enough difference for me to justify buying one over another Xpro. I liked it, but there wasn''t a signifigant difference in the things that mattered to me. First is shutter lag; they''re both excellent as long as you''re prefocused. Focus itself is a bit faster on the newer body, of course, but not fast enough to make a difference outside a sports stadium (and incidentally, the only long lens I own is manual). In low light, the XT was a bit better, maybe a stop, but it''s hard to say without doing a side by side test. The real killer is the viewfinder. Yes, the EVF is really good, better than any I''ve used so far. It still lags a little bit; optical viewfinders never do. Also, I really like the rangefinder style. You get a little more around the edges, yes, and there''s a bit of parralax error, but that helps. Somehow it makes visualization more real.

So much so that some photographers don''t even take pictures except during the two hours around sunrise and sunset. Bullshit I say. Of course, I''m saying this with a camera that holds detail for something like 11 or 12 stops in a decent ISO. It''s as good as negative film ever was, and that''s saying something. It''s exposed differently, but there''s incredible tonal range available. One of the reasons earlier street photographers shot in black and white is that it offered the ability to handle these super contrasty situations. The signs project, which I don''t think any of these go with (save the middle one), is sort of becoming about playing with ambiguity of evidence. So, a sharp clear photo that could be any number of events, interpreted any number of ways. I''m trying to wrap my head around the idea. Signs may tell you something, but how can you believe it? Why do you think the person who put it there isn''t just as lost as you? How do you know someone in the equation (the signmaker, the photographer, the people in the photo) aren''t actively working to deceive you? It''s still at the stage that there are more questions than answers, which is really fun for me. The not-fun part is not having a camera, not knowing when I will again, etc. Oh well.

Also they''re "hiring":http://www.engineyard.com/company/careers. The only downside so far is I''ve been so focused on work, especially the last month, that I haven''t had a whole lot of personal time. The reason I''m writing this is to try and make some time for myself. So that''ll be the last you hear from me about work for a while. I went out with my dad one night a couple of weeks ago, drinking good scotch, and the subject of just how lucky I am came up. A lot of very improbable things have happened to me, and that I survived them all with no long term damage (modulo occasional back problems, scars, and a trail of broken hearts) is also pretty remarkable. I lost count at 19, numbering the times I could have legitimately died if things had been just a little different. If I''d spiked a little more fever, or if I''d been hit a little harder by that car, or pavement, or whatever. Or if the right person hadn''t been there at the right moment to save me.

On my last two days, I flirted with the idea of staying for another week, but I knew that that would just turn into me extending the stay as long as possible (two weeks, then a month, then finding an apartment...). Not a problem for anyone out there, but a bitch for some people back here. Plus, I would have missed mothers'' day brunch, and I couldn''t have done that. photos somewhat tangential: <div class="center"> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/fireman_training/695/0026.jpg''> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/fireman_training/695/0027.jpg''> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/fireman_training/695/0028.jpg''> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/fireman_training/695/0029.jpg''> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/fireman_training/695/0030.jpg''> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/fireman_training/695/0031.jpg''> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/fireman_training/695/0032.jpg''> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/fireman_training/695/0033.jpg''> </div>', '2020-04-04 21:18:18', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'fireman_training', '2012-05-23 17:18:36', 1, false, NULL, false, '{fireman_training}');

I got back to the city, to my apartment, and ran into my neighbor Traci, who was on her way to get her bike fixed, and we decided to go for a ride after she got back. She comes back with an un-fixed bike. The sales guy talked down to her at the bicycle store, and so she walked out and told them her neighbor (me) would fix it. So, I had her bring the bike up and I wrenched on it for a bit and got it into running shape again. I made a part for it, even. So that was good. Then we went for our ride, just to downtown and back, and we both saw and remembered at the same time that the Arts Festival was happening downtown. So we went down there for a late lunch, and she bought mine to thank me for fixing her bike. Then we came home, only on the way I got a flat tire.

The second to last photo is something I''ve been experimenting with, calling them ''awkward compositions''. The idea is to take the natural composition, what I would instinctively do, and throw everything just a little off. So, instead of perfect thirds, you get half sky, half ground, and a line (the gaurdrail) going trough in the center. It''s an attempt to break out of my habits, more or less, and still make good photos. It''s hard to break habits that you''ve had for more than a decade; I''ve been a photographer longer than I''ve been anything else. I want to stay fresh, give myself challenges.

By the time I arrived, I''d only slept 2 hours in the previous 36, and I was a bit lagged. Even so, I was in a new place, and filing thoughts away for later. One thing I noticed was how there seemed to be some thought put into almost every structure. A bridge isn''t just a bridge, but an opportuity to show off. Even the corner liquor store was less molded plactic and stamped metal than you''d see here. The plan of going to brunch on arrival turned into go to lunch, and then stagger across half the city after a SIM card with Long (one of my co-workers).

Before my work trip to ireland, we were supposed to go camping with some friends we met through turntable; everybody bailed, basically, but we decided it''d be nice to get away for the weekend and have some quality time away from the world before I was gone for two weeks. The drive in was somewhat perilous, but also gorgeous. It didn''t help that I was trying and failing to beat sundown. Anyway, picture a dark dirt road with some washboard, some hairpin turns, a couple river fords (that''s places where you go in the water, instead of a bridge), and some cliffs. The beauty of the valley we were making out way down was not lost on me. There''s something really nice about moonlight. It looks like midday at first glance, but the shadows are super deep. Gone. There''s also the the chance that the photo won''t work at all; that my eyes are compensating for a contrast ratio that my camera can''t match. So it feels extra good. Once we got there, the trouble really started. We''d only brought one flashlight and no firewood, so we had to forage for it. In looking around for wood, I found one of the posts marking the parking area with my shin, fracturing it (I think; I never got an x-ray, but I still have a bump 6 weeks later). I found wood, though, and made a fire. Then, of course, we had to pitch the tent, and we slept on rocky, slanted ground. Sort of par for the course by that point. Then the morning came, and things started looking up. My shin was bloody, but didn''t hurt too much if I didn''t touch it. We made steak and eggs, moved the tent to a more level spot, and decided to go for a hike. We hiked down to the river, about 2 miles, and dipped our feet in. Cool and nice, and then I hung my hammock and did some real relaxing. At around 6pm, we decided not to spend another night; we''d had our night out, our relaxing by the river, even a nice hike. <div class="center"> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/camping_and_poor_planning/566/0001.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/camping_and_poor_planning/566/0002.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/camping_and_poor_planning/566/0003.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/camping_and_poor_planning/566/0004.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/camping_and_poor_planning/566/0005.jpg'' /> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/camping_and_poor_planning/566/0006.jpg'' /> </div>', '2020-04-04 21:15:30', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'camping_and_poor_planning', '2013-08-06 06:34:19', 1, false, NULL, false, '{camping_and_poor_planning}');

GGP is wonderful, an amazing little pocket of nature in the middle of the city. There''s a really fast stretch of downhill, and then the ocean; end of the line. The Pacific is wonderful.

The whole world and every single one of us in it has had kind of a shitty time. There are a few gleaming shiny bits of technology and a lot of death and hate and crap and that''s about it. Music has gone to hell. I haven''t seen any art that really floored me since about 2003, and all of that was made before 2000. What the hell, people? <br /><br />I think I have one answer- it''s not all of the answer, because so much shit comes from a lot of assholes- but for the first time ever, we have access to everything we want, ever. You know that impulse you have to look at every title in the bookstore at least once, so you don''t miss anything? Or to go through all the rooms in the thrift store, for that one special find? That same impulse combined with the internet and the exponential growth of things available to look at has completely consumed our collective conscious. It''s normal to be obsessed with something, and it''s weird to be disconnected. <br /><br />Here''s the catch: <span >obsessives are crazy</span>. Not the good crazy, the stay up for three weeks on benzedrine and write the great american novel crazy, but the found dead in her house with two dead cats under piles of used toilet paper rolls crazy. We have been so obsessed with mining all that is out there and finding the gems that we have made no time to create our own identity. You think to yourself if you can just finish this season of lost or get that Eames chair or write the perfect tweet, then you can be at peace, but that''s a lie.<br /><br />The truth is, there is no such thing as being finished. There is no rest until you''re dead, and no safety either. And as long as you spend your time keeping up with the latest and greatest of the whole world and all of your friends, you will have no time for yourself, to make the world a better place. <br /><br />I''m not saying to cut yourself off from twitter and facebook and all of that. They are wonderful tools for communication, and they should be used that way. You are not a one person broadcast to the world; you''re leaving a note for your friends. You can''t keep up with everything, so you might as well take the time to do something that''s worth sharing. <br /><br />And yes, I realize the inherent contradiction, putting this on my blog. Where the hell else am I going to put it? Why share something like this in a channel nobody cares about any more, like a dumb old magazine or newspaper. This is the fucking future, and we didn''t get our flying cars and vacations around venus and all that shit, but we did get blogs and iphones and all the tools we could ever dream of for making the world however we want it. Let''s let go of the old shit and get out there and create something of our own. <br /><br />Enough rant. I hope you read it and didn''t skip to the photos, even though I like these photos. I have more in this vein, including an expansion of what I mean about not being a broadcast for the whole world, but that''s another rant, and there are plenty of photos to bait you all with later, no? ;)<br /><br />Adam lock Was back in ton for like two seconds, and these are two from that night at Mcnellies.

You have been warned. I read "Mr. Penumbra''s 24 Hour Book Store":http://www.robinsloan.com/penumbra/ on the plane to SF, and it was a wonderful book. I devoured it, really; it''s got great pacing and mystery and all the things I like in a book. The characters are engaging, and I found myself rooting for the protagonist and the quest. Except... One of the plot points of the book is a code that remains unbroken for ~500 years. It''s called a substitution cypher in the book, and without revealing too many details, I just couldn''t believe that any substitution cypher would remain unbroken for that long. It was a bit of a let down. So, I did what any programmer would do: I built the thing. My somewhat incomplete implementation of cypher is "here":https://github.com/mattmills/penumbra-code. Having built it, it''s a bit more clever than I thought. Because there are only 26 letters (less in latin, but I don''t have any latin text to work from), and because there are a lot of glyphs (I stopped myself at 88 latin symbols that might be in a typeset), you can actually make english look like noise with this code, more or less. Once you know what you''re up against, though, it is breakable. I haven''t coded it yet, but there''s at least a brute force method, and maybe something more clever is possible. It sort of depends on how much noise there is in the signal; minimally, you need 80 glyphs to make a flat distribution over a large text, but with a larger character set you could have random noise inserted to confuse the signal. The more glyphs in the typeface, the more noisy you can make it. If you had, say, 200 glyphs, and only 80 of them meaningful, then that would confuse codebreakers pretty well. If anyone has suggestions, I''d love to hear them. Pull requests too.

But before I got there, I had to roll across two deserts, two mountain ranges, and untold small towns that I passed without even realizing. I covered half of I-40, coming and going. I know that road fairly well from my college days, but there''s a difference between a full on burn, at the edge of what''s possible for a college student to run out in the time he''s got to get to school, and a nice leisurely drive across half the country. On the way there, I split it across three days; six hours from home, I stopped in the New Mexico rest area and slept, after getting out and staring at the moon. There''s a kind of tired that''s familiar to anybody that''s done any solo driving. You start to feel it at the edges of things hours before you pull over-- a little ache at the corner of your eyes, wandering attention between songs on the radio. When you need to push, you can push through that kind of tired. It''s not safe, but it is at least interesting. I started to feel it before I got to Amarillo; I knew there were two rest areas before Albuquerque that would do, if I could make it, so I pushed through a little. Now, understand, this trip has nothing on some of the epically stupid things I''ve done; Once, I started to feel the same driving through Arkansas, and turned north to drive through Kentucky, for what I thought would be a shortcut through to Virginia; about 20 hours later, sans stop, I made it. It''s easy to lose yourself; to get disconnected from the moment. All that you see is a million miles of flat ground, and the same white and yellow lines; it''s easy to feel cut off from the rest of the universe. In that moment, the most important thing to do is concentrate. Lose focus, the mind wanders. Eyelids get heavy, and then it''s up to luck- bumps in the road, rumble strips, a song change on the radio. Or you don''t wake up. I have always been very lucky. Anyway, this time I decided to be at least a little rational, and stop and sleep not too far into the journey. I took pictures to try and get that feeling down, and there was a storm off to the northwest that helped-things wander, and then you get a jolt of the present that brings you back. <div class="center"> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/road_to_cali_(leaving_town)/678/0057.jpg'' > <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/road_to_cali_(leaving_town)/678/0058.jpg'' > <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/road_to_cali_(leaving_town)/678/0059.jpg'' > <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/road_to_cali_(leaving_town)/678/0062.jpg'' > <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/road_to_cali_(leaving_town)/678/0063.jpg'' > <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/road_to_cali_(leaving_town)/678/0060.jpg'' > </div>', '2020-04-04 21:17:54', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'road_to_cali_(leaving_town)', '2012-08-02 05:04:15', 1, false, NULL, false, '{road_to_cali_(leaving_town)}');

The idea isn''t complete, and it wouldn''t be interesting if it was. MOCA was freaking amazing. I''m not going to post any of the photos I took inside, because this isn''t an art history blog. I was stoked to see "John Baldessari":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7V4GyEuXA, Robert Irwin, and a bunch of others. I was surprised at the power of the Rothko; given a whole day, I would have sat on the bench and stared for hours. There were some Arbus prints, around a corner, badly lit, and really truly unimpressive. Really let the air out of that legend for me. Anyway, after that there wasn''t much to do but drive home. <div class="center"> <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/in_which_i_get_lost_in_downtown_la/672/0089.jpg'' > <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/in_which_i_get_lost_in_downtown_la/672/0090.jpg'' > <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/in_which_i_get_lost_in_downtown_la/672/0091.jpg'' > <img src=''https://images.matt.pictures/in_which_i_get_lost_in_downtown_la/672/0092.jpg'' > </div>', '2020-04-04 21:17:47', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'in_which_i_get_lost_in_downtown_la', '2012-08-07 05:05:43', 1, false, NULL, false, '{in_which_i_get_lost_in_downtown_la}');

In the days leading up to transit I was averaging 4 hours of sleep a night, and I got something like 3 hours in 30 getting here. So I&#8217;ve been bone-weary and hurting.

Not in a pure clean way, but in a lovely organic way. And the sheer scale of it keeps taking me by surprise. There are lots of small spaces created by twisty alleys and the like, but then you take a turn onto a throughfare and there are panoramas like that first photo. There&#8217;s a lot of dirt on everything here; it never rains to wash buildings away, and nobody has though of pressure washing, thank god, so buildings here are covered in dust and dirt.</p> <p><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/first_impressions_are_going_to_have_to_wait/858/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /></p> <p>(Aside: The 5AM call to prayer just rang out.) Earlier today, I was upstairs getting some tea (which felt great on my sore throat) and over loudspeakers from a nearby masque, a dude was leading prayers. And in what sounded like the middle of a sentence, he would just break into song for a measure or two, and then go back to talking. Completely acapella and spontaneous. He wasn&#8217;t much of a singer, but there was something beautiful about it, anyway. I was told once, by one of my professors in college, that the words of the Koran were so beautiful that there were often on the spot converts on hearing them. Which leads me to believe that that&#8217;s what the singing was. I could be wrong, though.</p> <p><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/first_impressions_are_going_to_have_to_wait/858/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /></p> <p>Then I went for a walk, just to get around and see the neighborhood a little bit. The architecture here is an odd mishmash of time periods when the country was flush and rubble. Seriously, there&#8217;s a lot of rubble from buildings torn down or fallen down. And again, there&#8217;s the scale of the place; it&#8217;s something I wasn&#8217;t struck by in any of the other big cities I&#8217;ve been to, but here the whole city is telling you it&#8217;s a big place. Tons of history. Lots of people.</p> <p><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/first_impressions_are_going_to_have_to_wait/858/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /></p> <p>There are lots of little struggles that fill up the day of someone like me, traveling in a country where I don&#8217;t speak the language. Getting food, for example. I have to just kind of point and hope for the best. Tea is easy; coffee also, plenty of that here. My money is holding up pretty well, although that may change as I eat more meals in the coming days. I think tomorrow may be a coding day; that way I can not have to worry about money so much. Although today was a coding day of sorts; I managed to get OAuth working for twitter on my blog, so the updates go to twitter and facebook again.

My spare 50 was at home in pieces, and my other lenses were also at home. This is the reality of getting ambushed with shoots in the middle of a road trip. Welcome to my life.</p> <p>Anyway, thinking that someone had spilled beer on my lens, I (somewhat desperately) ran it under the faucet in the bathroom, and that seemed to restore some limited movement to it, so I went with it. Of course, that wasn&#8217;t what the real problem was, and no water actually got in the lens because it&#8217;s weather sealed. More on that in a minute.</p> <p>Fast forward to the blue note tuesday night, and the lens had given up completely, and another rinse did nothing. Now, I&#8217;d already sent this lens to nikon once for this same problem, I told them to clean it, and when it came back it seemed all right. But here it was again, and so I was having visions of buying a new lens that wouldn&#8217;t have this recurring problem. Probably <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/5014af.htm">this one</a>. So, that decision made, I figured I had nothing to lose by taking the lens apart last night and seeing if I could at least figure out what was causing the problem.</p> <p>This isn&#8217;t as odd as it sounds. I&#8217;m pretty adept at fixing things in a general way. Cars, bikes, appliances, laptops, whatever. They&#8217;re machines, not magic boxes. So I got out my trusty phillips head and started unscrewing (protip: modern lenses usually disassemble from the flange). What I discovered, once I was inside, was, well, odd.</p> <p><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/saga_of_the_lens/843/20101014-kqd7x6qdr21aceeajgygpqgtek.jpg" alt="lens_inside_2"/></p> <p>The inside of the lens was more like a laptop than any of the other lenses I&#8217;ve worked on. That actually made it easier, thank god. Lenses are usually a bitch to work with, which is why I wait till I&#8217;ve got nothing left to lose to try anything. Anyway, one of the layers in my lens, the one marked in the photo above, was off, like it&#8217;d been knocked out of place. My suspicion is that it&#8217;s just held in place by spring tension, and a combination of bad knocks and bad luck threw it off. But, more to the point, it shouldn&#8217;t be loose like that. This is a top-line relatively new lens, supposedly professional grade. It certainly cost me enough.</p> <p>Anyway, now it&#8217;s back together and mostly working&#8230; the autofocus isn&#8217;t, but I can at least manually focus, and that&#8217;s enough for now. Maybe when I get that replacement lens I&#8217;ll tear it down again and see if I can fix it completely.</p> <p><span class="caps">COMING</span> <span class="caps">SOON</span>&#8230; Photos!

The visa was a piece of cake, just pay the man, get your sticker, and move on. I looked like what I am, a tourist/backpacker, and customs doesn&#8217;t give a fuck about guys like me. This is probably wise on their part.</p> <p>So I&#8217;m sort of wandering around, and a taxi driver approaches me, wants £80 to drive me into the city. I&#8217;m like, no way, there&#8217;s a bus that&#8217;ll get me there for way less. He tries to tell me there is no bus from the airport, yada yada, but I get on a shuttle and get to the airport bus terminal just fine. At this point I&#8217;m feeling quite good about myself and take some notes to the effect of &#8220;You&#8217;re not an idiot.&#8221; And then I waited an hour for a bus that I never saw, and shared a cab into the city with some other backpackers. I tried to get the cabbie to take me to an <span class="caps">ATM</span>, as my funds were low, but he didn&#8217;t understand. This is a recurring theme: English is useless here. Or nearly. So he dropped us off at the Cairo Museum, which was closed (probably for ramadan), and the other backpackers covered me. We wandered a bit in search of an <span class="caps">ATM</span>, no luck, so said our goodbyes and split off our separate ways.</p> <p>Thus began one of the great trudges of my life, in search of my hostel. I walked one way, and then another, and then a third. Then I ran into some British people with a guidebook, who told me how to get to Ramses Square, which is very close to where I&#8217;m staying, and so I set off walking. Unfortunately, what they said would be a 20 minute walk took the better part of 2 hours. There&#8217;s nothing quite like the self doubt you get when walking alone with a heavy pack in a foreign city, with no map and only a vague idea of where you&#8217;re going. So, I finally get to the square, and I can&#8217;t for the life of me find the street I&#8217;m supposed to go down to get to the hostel.</p> <p>So I call my mom, shout some (this is the loudest city in the world), mom gets on google to try and help. I&#8217;m trying to figure out where I am, exactly, because I&#8217;m not sure after all the walking and the self doubt. So I walk down one road for a little while, find a hotel with a sign in english, and she does directions from there to my hostel, and kinda directs me. I&#8217;m on the phone with her, and she&#8217;s talking me through getting there, when this guy comes up to me and asks me in english, &#8220;Can I help you?&#8221;</p> <p>So I show him the address of the hostel, and he knows the way, and we start walking. I never for a moment doubted this man; I could tell he wasn&#8217;t a con man or tout. Just a man, doing something good. Along the way, he shows me a blob on his hand that at one time was a cross. &#8220;I&#8217;m christian,&#8221; he tells me. &#8220;Coptic?&#8221; I ask. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said.

The kind of shit that freaks you out a little after 18-24 hours of no sleep and flying. Seriously, I was turned the fuck around just figuring out which terminal I was supposed to get to. You had to go down a long hallway, don stairs, around several bends, onto a bus, up two floors, down another hallway, descend one floor, go through security again, and then you&#8217;re there. But the departures board there doesn&#8217;t show a gate until right before time to board. So you have to wait in this packed shopping mall area (high end stuff, sure, but do I really need a Luis Vuitton or a Rolex while in the middle of an airport?).</p> <p><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/airplanes/860/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /></p> <p>About that: Flying kinda sucks. It should be the miracle of flight, wow, soaring, but instead we&#8217;re packed like sardines inside a stuffy, hot tin can. This might have something to do with the broken back last year making sitting for 8+ hours pretty uncomfortable (bordering on painful). I almost lost my watch and flashlight on the flight between Houston and london too. Actually, first I lost the cloth I put in my laptop to keep keyboard marks off the screen, and then I liost my watch reaching for it, and then I lost the flashlight looking for the watch. And a packet of cookies. I spent 2/3rds of the flight watchless and flashlightless, a little nervous that they were gone for good. And My knees were aching, I had a sinus headache from sonome&#8217;s perfume, and my back was acting up for the first time in months and months. In other words, a pretty typical trans-atlantic flight. edit to add: I&#8217;m drafting this again on my last flight, and this one I got a row all to myself. Instant Karma.</p> <p><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/airplanes/860/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /></p> <p>What else? I&#8217;m smelly, sweaty, and very tired. edit: now just smelly and tired.

I got up and made myself the perfect cup of coffee, Siracha coffee beans in the french press. Then I had another cup, the bottom of the pot, while I caught up on newsfeeds and twitter and all that. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >And then this is version 2.</span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/awake_and_working_after_the_party/1208/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />While I was chatting with Grant, I had a brilliant idea: convert my used cd''s into a radio scanner. What use is a scanner, you say? Information about what is going on. News as it happens. Things to take photos of. This particular conversion was by way of the used record store, so I grabbed all the ones that were worth anything, and started to head that direction.<br /><br />I got as far as my car, which I discovered was dead, and so I tried to start my other car (a mostly-broken mercury sable) and found that it too was dead. So I went back in the house, got my bike, and headed to the record store. <br /><br />I get to the shop, tell the lady I''m selling if she''s buying, and she takes my stack of cd''s to examine them and make me an offer.<br /><br />"$55?" the woman behind the counter offers, rejecting one. "Sure," I reply- it doesn''t seem like enough, but I''m hoping to hit up a pawn shop and get lucky. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/awake_and_working_after_the_party/1208/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />So the first pawn shop I go to, I have to explain that no, a scanner isn''t the same as a CB. They don''t have anything. I''m ready to give up on the day at this point, but as my path took me down reno towards downtown, I passed another pawn shop, and stopped in to see. <br /><br />This was one of those slightly sketchy places, the kind that sells more guns and ammo than anything. That, and they have a large selection of used tools. I asked one of the guys behind the counter, did they have any scanners? He allows that they do, right this way. He one pulls down from a shelf which is mostly pistol ammo, a handheld that seems perfect. I turn it over and see the price: $69.99. He''s gone off to ring up someone else, so I fiddle with it a bit, find out that it covers a ton of spectrum,and then when I get his attention, I ask him if he''ll take 50 for it. He says yes, 50 plus tax, and so I say sold. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >This was pretty much the entire crowd the whole time I was at Uptown.</span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/awake_and_working_after_the_party/1208/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />From there, I go to fourth street and ride into the city. Beatnix for lunch, and they really do have the best hot roast beef in town. If only they''d get sourdough bread, it''d be perfect. I sat there after my sandwich was finished, and programmed in all the frequencies that the public services us here in the city- something like 35 channels in all. Then I have business to do. <br /><br />The saga of the missing pictures continued with yours truly going to sauced and finding them still down, but Matty promised they''d be up by five, and that they were just moving things around, etc, etc. Which reminds me, I''ve gotta go back by there today and see what they put up, how it was done, and really if anything got done at all. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/awake_and_working_after_the_party/1208/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />I killed about two hours then, playing with my new radio in the park. The thing I''ve heard on that thing already are hilarious and interesting and I think it might work out to be a good thing.<br /><br />Dinner with Grant, Damaris, Timmy, Kolby, Erin, and this girl from Tulsa, can''t think of her name, it might come to me later. Indian food, way out on 23rd street, really good, really filling. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Random dude.

For most of the time I was there, there were more people chilling outside than inside dancing. And I do mean chilling.

The photographers he mentions for the most part shot with Leicas, cameras renowned for their speed, quality, and ability to work in low light even with the ISO 400 films of the time. (The author of that piece confuses old color emulsions, which were very slow, with black and white, which have been reasonable since the mid nineteen thirties). Henri Cartier-Bresson, one of my personal heroes, whom he mentions by name, was famous for almost always using a 50mm f/2 lens and ISO 400 Tri-x, moderately fast film with incredible tonalities possible. <br /><br />I''m not saying it''s impossible to make good photos with cheap or lesser cameras. I''m even using some of the shots from my old G9 in the book I''m trying to produce. But telling people to buck up and try harder in the face of the crap that is the consumer camera market right now, well, that''s bullshit. The factors that are comparable are not the important ones to photographers. The important things are all related to creative control and perspective. The reason little digital cameras mostly suck is you have little control over how the thing sees; it''s very hard to fit your vision into a little screen. Here''s a list of the things that do matter, though:<br /><br />1. Format size. This comes before every other consideration, as it is a defining characteristic of how the camera will work, its weight, how the image is printed, how depth of field is established, all sorts of things. Bigger gives higher technical image quality, and smaller means better ease of use. My personal choice is the 24x36mm rectangle- a good balance between optical and tonal qualities and the ability to move around. Notice I say here "format" and not "megapixels"; the difference being that format is very important and megapixels aren''t anymore. <br /><br />2. Shutter Lag. THIS WAS ALMOST NUMBER ONE. That''s because it''s so often overlooked and it''s perhaps the most important to the most photographers (potential and actual). A camera''s shutter lag needs to be small, less than one tenth of a second, for it to be remotely useful in getting a moment, which for me is all of photography. Most crappy (P&S) cameras, you could press the shutter button, go have lunch, come back, start a pot of coffee for the afternoon, and then, finally, the camera will make the exposure. Completely unacceptable. In most old manual cameras, this wasn''t a problem, because the mechanical path from the shutter to the button was short and fast. <br /><br />3. Focal Length. You may say that for a given photographer, they will have many lenses, but many tend toward one end of the spectrum or another- James Nachtwey uses wide angles a lot, Cartier-Bresson preferred the fifty (normal in his preferred 35mm format), paparazzi live and die by their telephoto lenses, and if you ask ten photographers, you''ll get ten answers, all unique. I''m a normal and wider kind of photographer, 50 and 20. <br /><br />4. Minimum F/stop- This determines the most amount of light that the lens can allow to pass through. I cart around a huge honking 50mm f/1.2, which gathers light somewhat akin to a radio telescope collecting signal, but that''s because I work in dark rooms with sketchy nonexistent lighting a lot. For most people, f/2 is plenty for most situations.<br /><br />OK, so for most point and shoots, the lenses suck, the format sucks, the viewing sucks, and the shutter lag is longer than a smoke break. It''s a miracle these things make pictures at all. You almost have to be a savant to get anything good out of them. To the people out there that know better, please stop bullshitting amateurs into thinking that their camreras are capable machines, because more than likely the machine sucks and they haven''t a hope of getting better with it. <br /><br />PS- Ken Rockwell, while being a little odd a lot of the time, has a lot of good smart things to say about photography and cameras, so long as you know he''s joking half of the time. The other guy makes some good points, too, but really, if the camera didn''t matter, we''d all be painters.

This book is the result of 5 different edits, three of which were complete restarts from the original 25,000 pictures. It took me 6 months to get this far, a herculean task if there ever was one, so you really won''t ever get the full reasoning behind what is in the book. Photographers and picture editors reading this, if you''ve ever had a 25,000 picture project all in your head, will understand what I''m talking about. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/for_the_haters/1102/0056.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/for_the_haters/1102/0057.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />There are two reasons I put pictures in the book: either they told a part of the story, I thought they were a good picture, or more usually, both. Of the individual portraits, I tried not to have more than two or three of anybody, and I think I did that... but there are also pictures that are more about the things that are happening, and I didn''t really think about who was in those at all. Except I did, kinda. The second edit featured a couple of people more prominently, and I actually trashed that one because I didn''t like the way it felt with those people at the front. It''s not about any one person, or any three, but about an indefinite number somewhere between 20 and 50, about what you can fit into a two bedroom apartment for a decent party. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/for_the_haters/1102/0058.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/for_the_haters/1102/0059.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />That said, I think I''m going to go back and write little vignettes about the pictures... not captions, but stories to go with them.

The shooting is very different. A lot of people will talk about the different qualities of the images, the grain structure, all of that, but something I really like is how few pictures there are on a roll. You get to be way more critical of what you&#8217;re shooting, what you see; instead of hitting the button and then looking to see what I can do better, I find myself making those checks (frame edges, composition, etc.) before I click the shutter. <br/><br/> Another thing: developing film is the closest thing to magic us mere mortals can do. Roll the film onto the developing reels in the dark, then put on the lid, turn on the lights, and run it through the developer (FG-7, if you care), the stop bath, and the fixer, and then you can pull out the negatives and see all of your pictures at once. It&#8217;s the most boring regular process ever, but at the end you have these perfect little jewels, full of potential.

Meow Wolf is an art installation, but it’s also a story told as a house and a music venue and tourist trap? and also really weird. Just bananas. If the gift shop stocked more XL stuff, I’d have at least one new hoodie, and probably a t-shirt, but oh well. If you get a chance, go. It’s worth an afternoon to get the experience. I’m actually also looking forward to revisiting to check out all the detail, which I’ll be doing next time I pass through. Just lavish amounts of attention paid to story and character of all these objects and rooms.

After Santa Fe, we got a good night’s sleep (which we needed, still really tired from the 18 hour day on the road the day before) and had a milk run getting into OKC the following evening.

not to bore you with technical details, but I’m putting this here so I can remember as much as anything else: Why am I wrapping all the images in headline (H1) tags?

funny story: Markdown, which is sort of a shorthand-HTML language, has what we in the business call “significant line breaks,” which means that when you press the enter key, it does stuff. It also makes assumptions about block elements versus inline elements that aren’t, like, 100% true, but that play into this. The long and the short of it is that if you have image tags all by their lonesome, Markdown assumes they need to be part of a block element, and wraps them in a &lt;p&gt; tag. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1279/8A883B44-8CC5-4B72-8453-ABAE7C13823C.jpeg)

Now, this would be fine if I wanted my paragraphs and my pictures to have the same style, but I do not. Paragraphs should be narrow for readability, and pictures should be big, for the same reasons (also cf. Shelah Wilson, one of my college profs, “More is More”). So, a workaround that took me years to figure out, that you can have for free: wrap your images in H1 tags, like so: `# [alt text](image url here)`. Headlines are block elements. H1 is one I almost never use, and I can avoid it and scale H2, H3, etc to fit my needs. So I’ll probably never style it.

So there: today’s tip in working around the limitations of Markdown.

So I’ve been using a system called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to publish the blog for many years. It’s a great system for a narrow range of uses; if you’re writing from a computer, and have minimal image needs, and know git and the command line reasonably well, it’s easy and intuitive to set up and use on a little server somewhere on the internet. Since it generated static files, it’s very fast once deployed. It also helped that at the time it was written in my language-of-choice, and could use my flavor of templating language (textile, although I’ve since switched to markdown).

So here I am, 7 years later. I do most of my writing and image processing on my iPad, saving the big computer for things like heavy photoshop and ‘real’ work. Not that photo-editing and writing aren’t real, but they don’t need the big iron. (Yes I am totally a nerd that thinks of his computer as Big Iron, like a gun in an old country song). Actually, probably nothing I do _really_ needs a ton of processing power; I always want for more but what I know I need instead, from years in the trenches of writing it, is software that is more optimized for my needs; this is pointed especially at the super laggy desktop versions of Lightroom. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1275/4FBD9E58-2F59-404B-8C68-AE318F5F0EB8.jpeg)

So we come back to this here blog. I could compose it by hand in HTML, but we’re not banging rocks together here. I’m a damn software developer, I make rocks think for a living. Seriously, like I was saying above, what I need is a piece of software tailored to my needs. Now, all software is eventually tech debt, and really you should avoid writing it as much as practicable, but dammit, I wanted to blog from the iPad. 

Since I started using jekyll, the world has moved on. I changed jobs roughly once a year, picked up some skills, then some more, then forgot a lot of it, specializing in a language called Elixir. Elixir has a few things going for it, mostly heavily technical, but the sum of those technical parts is it’s very reliable, and very fast. Something like an order of magnitude (that’s 10 times faster for those at home) faster than Ruby programs doing roughly the same thing (YMMV, benchmarks are not actual usage, etc etc). I built a system in 2015 to speed up a part of a system at {undisclosed employer} and it was a ton faster and everyone was happy. A month later, we got to looking at the memory usage graph, and saw a weird sawtooth pattern. The processes were dying every 36 hours or so because the box was running out of memory, and nobody had noticed for a month. The reason being the reliability I was talking about. The process dies, and the system that runs the code (called a ‘virtual machine’) just restarts it, and because of the rest of the architecture of the system, nothing was lost. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1275/CB9EE432-560B-4775-A0B4-8E8764730433.jpeg)

But Jekyll was working for me, and until recently, I basically thought, you know it’s just barely possible to blog from the iPad, if I make a big effort, I can do it. And I think a few of the posts since last September were part of that struggle. It was clunky. It was slow. It required 5 different apps, including ssh’ing into my server, to make it go, but it went. 

And then, I didn’t blog for a while. Lots of reasons. The Ankle that took me out for several months. Travel, which should result in a ton of blogging, just didn’t. Maybe I was tired, but it didn’t help that I was fighting the tooling. It’s a poor craftsman that blames his tools, of course, but a worse one that doesn’t recognize when there’s room for a better hammer. 

So, a couple weeks ago, I started work on this, a new, streamlined blog, and a couple days ago, it went live. The first new post directly precedes this one. Old posts were imported, but old links have been broken. Sorry. It’s a pretty simple web app, with a login and some forms that create database entities that correspond pretty much exactly to what you see on the screen: posts and design and pictures. The pictures also got an improvement: they’re sized to fit your screen, instead of a static width. The visual design as a whole is a work in progress; changes coming there. I may add more features. Don’t expect comments.

So I blogged about Thursday evening, and then took my laptop into the kitchen for some browsing and conversation. I plugged in the laptop so it could charge, and then when I got up I tripped over the cord and knocked it onto the floor, breaking the screen. So, sans laptop, I didn''t blog or process pictures the rest of the weekend. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >Steves was there, somewhat improbably.</span><br /><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/home,_where_the_laptop_is/1219/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />That afternoon, there was an alley cat and a movie premiere. I got DFL in the alley cat, and saw half the movie, which looked pretty good, and then decided to strike out towards the action. There were free drinks somewhere, I could smell them. Come to think of it, that might have been the empty beer in my hand. Oh well. <br /><br /><span class="caption" >The bikes piled up before the alleycat. Yay dfl!</span><br /><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/home,_where_the_laptop_is/1219/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />That night, my luck was a little better. We got in to a party with free tequila, but then, standing in a long line waiting for drinks, Sarah decdided to go see Devo, who I don''t care about, and so we all left the party with the free booze and I went and walked sixth street for a couple hours while they were at the show. That''s where I saw the coolest thing of the whole trip. <br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><br /><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/home,_where_the_laptop_is/1219/0004.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />There was a guy standing between two van de graaff (lightning) generators, all covered in chainmail. The lightning striking him was modulated so that the lightning was a speaker. The lightning noise was the music.<br /><br /><span class="caption" >F''ing amazing.</span><br /><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/home,_where_the_laptop_is/1219/0006.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />From there, I wandered until my feet hurt, then sat a little, then wandered a little, in a "diminishing returns" situation until I was walking a block and sitting on a curb for five minutes, and then getting up and moving along. Somewhere in there was pizza and a coke. Then Devo was over, and everyone went back to the party with the free drinks, where, after I''d had one beer and one shot of tequila, they ran out of booze.<br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><br /><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/home,_where_the_laptop_is/1219/0005.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br />Back at the house to sleep, only to wake up in the morning to no computer and no internets. Saturday was half-decent DJ''s during the day followed by a rather nice evening hanging with Todd (my host, remember) and his girlfriend Kelli. Fairly interesting people, the both of them. Todd really really needs to show his paintings in a gallery.

Now I have to get photos off the camera. <br /> <br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/it''s_been_seven_days_since.../1043/0043.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/it''s_been_seven_days_since.../1043/0044.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/it''s_been_seven_days_since.../1043/0045.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/it''s_been_seven_days_since.../1043/0046.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/it''s_been_seven_days_since.../1043/0047.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/it''s_been_seven_days_since.../1043/0048.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/it''s_been_seven_days_since.../1043/0049.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/it''s_been_seven_days_since.../1043/0050.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/it''s_been_seven_days_since.../1043/0051.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br /><br /><span class="caption" ></span><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/it''s_been_seven_days_since.../1043/0052.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />', '2020-04-04 21:59:00', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'it''s_been_seven_days_since...', '2009-12-27 00:00:00', 1, false, NULL, false, '{it''s_been_seven_days_since...}');

Also: I didn''t mean that there was nothing good happening anywhere, just that only a few pieces of art (and by art I mean writing, painting , photography, and any creative endeavour) were what I''d call transformative, that stick with you, that change you, that have a lasting effect. Then I realized, on reflection, that a small number of works like that might be normal. Not that the worlds sucks, but you don''t make the mona lisa every day, either.

So, on that, I''m waiting. <br /><br />Injuries: everything was better today, except for right after I woke up; moving around a little worked out the little bit of stiffness that I had, and the only thing that''s bothered me all day has been my ankle, and that only in the last couple hours. For some reason, bad days seem to follow the good ones, and I''m more than a little afraid of waking up in agony. Maybe that''s why I can''t sleep. No pain pills today though, that''s something. <br /><br />On the subject of pain pills, I''m somewhat divided, because on the one hand, they allow me to function on the bad days, at the worst moments, I can still get out of bed and move about the house, but I''m always a little hazy on those days, and it''s nice to be clear. Would I just be in bed, suffering? Does pain by itself slow healing? When will I stop feeling like I''ve been hit by a car at 35mph?<br /><br />Questions for the doctor (appointment on the second): How long will it take me to recover? How much of a recovery can I expect to make? Am I permanently damaged? When can I get rid of the shell? Where is the break exactly? Can I see my X-rays? How much PT (physical therapy) will I need? <br /><br />Questions for the lawyer: How hard is this going to be? Is all of my stuff (bike, camera) covered? How much PT will I be able to afford? What about lost work time/income? <br /><br />I''ve got lists of things that I need and/or want; things that are missing, notably my passport and notebook and flask; lists that I don''t know if I''ll ever tick off all the items or not. How is it that despite being an invalid unable to drive or walk I have so much to accomplish? And the number of little side things on my mind, besides. For example: I have to get my car registered and licensed this week, and I''m thinking about either getting an iphone or fixing the netbook, but I don''t really know which to do, and I can''t do anything at all about these things till friday, which is when I get my last paycheck from OSU. The paycheck is a surprise, though. I''m glad for it, and that I''ll be able to fix/do stuff once I get it. <br /><br />Then there''s all the nice stuff people have done for me, from loaning books to bringing me beer to just coming over and hanging out and talking. I have a stack of comic books that I''ve read thanks to Cyrus and a bunch of DVDs that I''ve half watched on the nod, thanks to Adam M. I had the best cup of coffee I''ve ever tasted while I was still in the hospital thanks to Francois. I''ve got beer and good literature thanks to Stuart. I''m just now digging into the lit. Ken got me a freakin'' camera, even if it is just on loan for a while. That''s why there''s still a trickle of pictures up here. I haven''t forgotten any of you, and I''m trying to think of something nice to do, in gratitude, once I''m back on my feet.<br /><br />That''s about it. I think I''ve gone from the surface to the deep parts of what''s on my mind. If I wrote any more, I''d be telling my life story, as all the other thoughts I have are just snippets of anecdotes from disconnected stories.', '2020-04-04 22:03:54', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'it''s_6:30_and_i''m_still_up._time_to_give_up_on_sleep?', '2009-05-25 00:00:00', 1, false, NULL, false, '{it''s_6:30_and_i''m_still_up._time_to_give_up_on_sleep?}');

I suppose that may still be true, but for some reason, acknowledging the upswing seems cursed. Before the ink is dry on the digital sentence "things are better," they suddenly won''t be. 

That same day, tuesday, I''d done some exercises, including some squats. Didn''t feel anything amiss, went through my day like normal, worked, blogged, went to bed. Got up the next morning, had a little twinge in my right knee, didn''t seem like anything. Then, throughout the day, it got worse, until I couldn''t bend it at all without a lot of pain, and lifting the leg, like when you get into bed, was excruciating. By the time I got into bed, I was in enough pain that I couldn''t sleep, and finally, at around 3am, I woke Sophie up and sent her downstairs to grab some pain meds I had left over from my ankle surgery. 

When you go to the doctor with an injury, they will often ask you to give the pain a number, from 1-10. I''ve had a couple 10s; when I was hit by a car on my bike and broke my back (T12 spinal fracture, minimal complications, recovery time: 1 year); when I got a kidney infection in Dahab, Egypt and had to go to the hospital for 3 days. This time, wednesday night, was probably a 9, at the moments I was trying to move it, like when I wanted to get into bed or get up to use the toilet. Anything above a 7 feels like you''re doing damage to yourself; I''ve had broken bones that didn''t hurt that much (toes, the occasional finger). 6-7 is where I lose the ability to sleep, and it was sort of the resting state of things early thursday morning. 

All that to say, when you''re in the middle of it, it''s very hard to qualify. If you''d asked me for a 1-10 number at the time, I''d have said 9 for the resting state, and 10 for moving it. Even though a 10 is usually reserved for what I think of as "actively dying," like I should be in a trauma center ASAP (and the two times I listed above did require hospitalization). Looking back at it, I''m thinking it wasn''t as bad. ', '2020-05-03 20:55:24', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'busted_knee_(on_pain)', NULL, 1, false, NULL, false, '{busted_knee_(on_pain)}');

Whe I first saw it, I thought it wasn''t that bad, but after a second look, I realized the wound, while small, was all the way through the skin and really needed some kind of closure. I jokingly said I could stitch it up if we could find a needle and thread. <br /><br />Now, I do have some pretty good first aid training and experience under my belt, so when Timmy actually wanted me to stitch it up, I thought, ok, no problem, told him it would hurt, but we could do it. So we all went back to grant''s house, and we got out a needle and thread, I sterilized it in bleach, and we waited for grant to get back from the store with some peroxide to clean out the wound. Before you even think it, yes, I know that peroxide robs the tissue of oxygen, but iodine is harder to get in the middle of the night. <br /><br />We all go into the dining room and I lay down a towel and pour in the disinfectant. It''s a little cut, but it really needed like two stitches to close it and keep out infection. It wasn''t going to close on its own. So, I stick the needle in. It goes through with a little pushing, and then refuses to come out the other side. So I pull it out, bend the needle some more, and try again. Still no joy; the point is just too dull.<br /><br />We talk about taking him to a doc-in-a-box clinic, and Grant is looking up phone numbers when somebody brings up the possibility of super glue. I don''t remember who, but I''m still kicking myself for not thinking of it before I tried to stitch him up. It''s perfect for little out of the way wounds that need to be closed but can''t be sutured for whatever reason (lack of insurance and sharp needles this time). So, Grant goes to the store again, gets some super glue, and the cut is fixed up better than the ER would have done in about five seconds.<br /><br />Moral of the story: Don''t forget the super glue.', '2020-04-04 22:04:44', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'always_remember_the_super_glue', '2009-03-27 00:00:00', 1, false, NULL, false, '{always_remember_the_super_glue}');

At least, I think it''s new, and if it isn''t, well, I don''t know anybody that does it. The idea is, a lot of people like to have good pictures of their family; in fact, this is the only thing a lot of people care to have pictures of. But studio pictures from places like walmart or sears or even glamour shots suck.<br /><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/candid_portraits_for_hire/1232/0002.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />So instead of a studio, what about the home? And instead of a quick grin-and-grab, what about spending some time with the family, say two hours- over dinner, maybe, or an afternoon in the park? Candid pictures the whole time, and give the family digital copies that they can do whatever they want with? If they want to order prints through me, that''s fine, but I''d rather make money shooting than printing, so that''s where the charges come from.<br /><img src="https://images.matt.pictures/candid_portraits_for_hire/1232/0003.jpg" alt="Photos" /><br />The pictures here in this post were shot in the space of about an hour and a half; These aren''t all of the keepers, just enough for a teaser.

Well, there was a bit of technical difficulty at the beginning (I had changed my manual ip to try to get my comp working on their network, and voila, it worked, but then the guys out front couldn''t connect to me. Never mind they could''ve found me in the network browser). But being a little pissed just sharpened me up, and I hit all the marks just right.

I get no response, and in short order I had worked through my extra cards. So, I ran out to their area, and in the process, missed a dance routine. Threw me off the rest of the afternoon. Got heated there for a second and I was tempeted to walk off from the whole thing, but my better nature prevailed, and I''m still employed. that is, they didn''t fire me for a mistake, and I didn''t walk off mad. <br /><br />Then dinner, and my boss was in hot water for us leaving "early." Early being maybe 15 minutes to beat the crowd. Oh well, now nobody in the whole crew gives a shit, we''re only doing this job for the money anyway.

I have this tendency to concentrate so much on what I''m photographing that I walk out into the road to get the right angle, and not notice oncoming cars.

There is something really nice about getting on the road. Even though I don’t have the endurance for driving that I once did; there was a time when I could get in the car and drive for 20 hours, easy. Now, I’m doing good to get 6 in a day. This day, to start, we had to detour through Lawton, to get Sophia’s keys, which she’d left in the car of a friend the night before, and subsequently he’d gone home to Lawton. All in all, it really only lost us like an hour, so 9 hours that day instead of 8.

took these in february, at the penultimate salon this year. It was a great show, and I found myself once again drawn to the margins. There''s so much going on at a show that''s essential to its existence, but not on the stage. The ticket takers at the door, the merch table, the people running AV. Fearless was a really good show, and you can see the videos on [Odd Salon''s Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/oddsalon).

not much to say. just letting things marinate. Haven’t been sleeping terribly well, what with the lockdown and the pandemic. Not getting out of the house is hard when that’s a main coping mechanism. I totally get it, I understand the reasons; doesn’t make it any easier. I’ve been going on a couple walks a week, as a sort of minimum viable exercise. I’m going to have to branch out soon, or start taking the bike instead; the photos on the route I’ve been taking are getting a little stale. Or maybe it’s the lack of sleep.

Anyway, these photos are from the last day of our road trip home. A milk run from Needles to Oakland, about 8 hours according to google maps, which is about what I remember. There was snow crossing the first set of mountains, which was pretty wild, as they’re usually pretty hot and barren. Right time of year for a freak storm, but it’d passed a couple days ahead of us. Then the surrealist masterpiece, the 5, most of the day. We were still driving after dark, coming over the coast range on 680, I think.

I don’t have any writing that’s like... fully baked at the moment. I’m thinking about some things, though. Blogging seems, overall, a much more positive way to spend my energy online. There’s no real feedback mechanism, unfortunately. I could add likes and comments pretty easily, but I don’t wanna. I think one of the things blogging is helps with is breaking some of the small feedback loops in favor of bigger ones.

Producing work, consistently, on a scale of months and years, is something that separates the real from the dilettantes (maybe. or maybe you take one perfect picture once. don’t ask me, I can’t tell you). Anyway, I’m going to have to ruminate on that and work it into a thesis, but there’s something to not being part of anyone else’s feed, just producing my own. Different priorities. The impossibility of going viral (well, much reduced). Anyway, yeah, that’s a sketch of what might become a whole essay.

The hard part of the quarantine is certainly coming to a middle. At first, and even before social distancing, I was plagued by the implications of the numbers. If the infections reached saturation, and the death rates held, it was going to be something like 2 million people dead. A lot of stiffs. And while we haven’t really done shit but stay home, we don’t currently have 2 million dead people causing cascade failures of our cemetery and mortuary industries, so that’s one thing I worried about. There have been rumors of mass graves in some places (maybe more than rumors, but I’m not going to chase them down). So for about two days the thought of mass graves plagued me, but I was able to let that go, and then I thought of other ways in which the world was going to fall apart. That lasted another couple days, but then lockdown settled into a routine, and I was fine. Ish.

I was taking walks, I was exercising, wearing a mask as soon as everybody realized they were maybe effective. Things were as OK as they could be; I was cooking a lot, doing recipes I’d gotten of youtube. Then, I decided I needed to add some leg exercises to my routine. I did some squats. Like 10 of them. Next day, I’m having some knee pain, and it gets worse all day. The doc over zoom the next morning said sometimes inflammation is like that. So, I’m hobbling around on one leg, and a couple days later, the ankle on the other leg decides it’s had enough and resigns in protest. That was two weeks ago.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1300/42F483E0-63AC-4E05-8603-D119323ED9BC.jpeg)

The knee really is a lot better now; I’m not having issues with it on the stairs any more. The ankle is still not right, and won’t be, I suspect, for another week at least. Everything is at a low ebb. Can’t stop Won’t stop, though.

lot of irons in the fire at the moment. Protest photos, and the ethics thereof; a whole essay on why software sucks sometimes; a stack of photos from mid-march on. These were on the third of march, election day. I voted for Warren, for the record.

So, while all those things are still getting sorted and falling into place, I figured I should just push out a blog post. Some photos, a little update. Things are moving, here. Knee is mostly better, ankles have good and bad days. They still haven’t arrested the cops that killed Breonna Taylor, but we’re still in the streets (It took prosecutors a year to file charges against Oscar Grant’s killer, for reference). But/and: Just heard SF public schools is following Oakland’s lead and ending their relationship with SFPD. It’s not all bad news. We can do better, be better, and we will.

So what am I doing? While I was having trouble getting around, I was mostly trying to spread good information (protest tactics, anti-racism resources) mostly via twitter, and also donating money to a lot of stuff that came over the transom. I didn’t tweet too much about that, seemed too much like bragging to my midwestern upbringing. I’ve been taking comfort in little bits of poetry that come back to me, bits of Ulysses and Lays of Ancient Rome (“How can man die better than facing fearful odds...”) and others too. Roethke and Baldwin, too.

Now that I am getting around a little better, I went to a protest last Friday at the port, and it was amazing. I’ll probably write more about it when I actually post the photos.

Remember parties? This was a good one. Kawan’s place in the mission is really rad. It’s a regular 1-bedroom, but instead of like, a living room, he has a studio. Great big windows, tons of light. Also, and I feel like I say this every year, but he has a lot of rad people hanging around.

It’ll be a long time before we can have a carefree gathering like this again. For the time being, not partying counts as partying, in the Andrew WK sense of the word. There’s a whole treatise on partying in the texts of WK as mystical monism, but it is very late and I do not have the strength. Maybe after I finally write that false vacuum/local minima essay I’ve been threatening.

Last week was kind of a shit show, don''t know if you could tell from the blogging, but I was kind of a mess. Bad sleep, unable to focus on doing stuff during the day, one particularly bad panic episode that saw me going to three stores and driving through the parking lot of a fourth to get new locks for the house (which was a thing I needed to do anyway, one of our spare keys went missing, but probably not quite so rushed). The calm distance from the first three or four weeks of social distance is gone, and I’m just treading water at the moment. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1294/0003.jpg)

All that said, continuing to shelter in place is the right thing to do. Many more people will die if we don’t. It’s nuts to think that some states are talking about opening up as early as next week, (fact check me; I don’t actually know any of the dates, but Oklahoma and Georgia, my home state and the place of my birth, respectively, are making asses of themselves). 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1294/0002.jpg)

I''m doing a little better this week, trying to manage my sleep better, at least. The world is pretty messed up right now, and it''s easy to fall in to despair. But I can''t think of a time where that wasn''t true, either. I was reminded, by a friend, of the end of [Ulysses](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45392/ulysses):

> Death closes all: but something ere the end,  
> Some work of noble note, may yet be done,  
> Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.  
> The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:  
> The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep  
> Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,  
> ''T is not too late to seek a newer world.

I have an essay to work up about local minima and false vacuum; I _think_ there are parallels to our current situation; the current situation is a local minima, and the new ground state is out there, waiting to happen.

So, a couple days ago, I started writing what was going to be the first post on here in about a week. I got a good three paragraphs into an essay on the pain scale they give you when you go to the doctor, and then I was like, ''I''m tired, let''s go sleep'' and well, you know the rest, because that post didn''t happen. It''s in my drafts.

In the meantime, bear with me as I''m have some difficulty moving around the house, which makes getting to my computer in the basement to do image editing, especially at the end of the day like I''ve been doing, kind of difficult. I keep running out of [spoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory). Really, the last year or so of not having decent mobility a lot of the time has been a drag. Hopefully, in a week or so, the tendons in my left ankle and right knee will be done being mad at me, and normal service will resume.

These were just like, a random Friday (except the last one, which I shot from the car earlier that week). We just decided to gather at a local bar, grabbed our going-out stuff, and went. I think we even rode bikes to the first bar? Ah, the memories.

I joke, but only a little. I did get to leave the house this weekend; after complaining about it friday, I switched from the ankle boot to a brace which lets me have a normal gait, but is less protective, and that’s made a huge difference in my mobility. I can actually just walk around the house a bit, unload the dishwasher, etc. We went to a little parklet in a friend’s neighborhood, saturday, so at this rate those photos will be out in about... two months. We all sat over 6 feet apart, but it was nice to sit in the sun with some friends, at least for a little bit.

Today was a banner day: I got to look at a potential space to rent for light industrial work, so I can move the welder and metalwork out of my current space, and maybe even the sewing table? Or maybe the electronics. It’s somewhat out of my hands, but it would be really nice, if it works out.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1302/78CC0BCB-0D84-4368-A802-C227496E2327.jpeg)

Also today: we went for a drive, over the Richmond Bridge, to the Marin Headlands, which were closed to vehicles, and then to almost the top of Twin Peaks, where there was also a road closure and a bunch of people trying to park and walk. We paused at intervals and took pictures from the car. It wasn’t going on a nature hike or anything, but it was pretty nice after being inside the house for two weeks.

I keep saying what this project needs is portraits. San Pablo is people, and for a long time, I thought of myself almost exclusively as portrait photographer, shooting what’s known as environmental portraits. People are invariably more interesting than stuff, I thought. and also, the project has seemed a little rudderless. Like “Now what?” So, portraits make sense. But. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1298/CA08C210-CB5A-4B0B-AEFB-DD4E8BAE6424.jpeg)

but. I keep going out and shooting these abstractions. These things that are definitely not portraits (or are they? some feeble art-school thought whispers). I’ll get myself together to go out to shoot, and just completely freeze when I think about approaching people. In New York, I didn’t have this problem. Here, for some reason, I do. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

And, they definitely work on some level. It turns out my documentary photo project on the socioeconomic inequality in America through the lens of this one weird street is actually a weird art project about the same weird street? There are projects that require fighting, and leveling up, and do the thing you set out to do. The bike frame project is that for sure. One thing I’ve learned over the years, though, is sometimes you have to go with the grain of the material you’re using.

I remember there was this project I did in college. Speaking of bikes, it was about a local program that did free bike repair, called RecycleABike or something. Great people, taught me a lot about wrenching. But the photos from the workshop weren’t gelling into something I could use. So I decided to do something I’d been wanting to do, but hadn’t thought was ‘right’ or ‘documentary enough’. I brought a bunch of the people into the studio, took portraits against a white psych (one at a time), and did interviews at the same time, all in little 45 minute sessions. Took me maybe a week, and the whole project was done. Felt amazing.

Does this need to be a documentary project? Does the primary limitation I’ve set for myself need to be front and center in the final edit? The ‘grain’ of this project, so far, is not that of the standard sense of place stuff I was thinking it would be. I’ve read a lot of novelists’ accounts of writing, and finding somewhere along the way an unexpected turn in the story. This isn’t that, but it’s the same energy. The work is telling me something.

I think I got most of it, although the part about novelists was in the middle, and I concluded talking about a couple other projects that turned on me that way. seems fine now.)', '2020-05-08 06:49:16', '2021-12-27 02:38:58', 'san_pablo,_chapter_something', '2020-05-08 07:34:49', 1, false, NULL, false, '{"san_pablo,_chapter_something"}');

So, sometime in february, we visited the animal sanctuary WildCare, in San Rafael, which is Marin County, for those that don’t live in the Bay Area. They take in animals of all stripes, many found injured and in need of veterinary care, and rehabilitate the ones they can, and the ones that can’t be released, they keep at their facility. They serve as ambassadors for what the sanctuary does. I think I’ve talked about them before, but I really can’t remember.

While we were there, we got to see the Peregrine they have. I was trying to take a picture, and through the viewfinder, I couldn’t see the fence really. So when the bird decided to go from one perch to another by flying right at me, I jumped right back. Raptors are terrifying when they’re zooming through the air at you. That’s the original meaning of the ‘terrible lizard’, the dinosaur: scary, as in it’ll claw your eyes out.

Not Vlad though. Vlad is the vulture in the first and last pictures. Calm, regal, really a nice bird. Eats carrion, mostly, found as a little chick and someone hand-fed him until they couldn’t handle him, and then turned him over to WildCare (if I’m remembering the story correctly, which I may not be). So, he doesn’t have any of the fear of people, or other learned behaviors that would allow him to survive in the wild. Protip: if you see a baby bird on the ground, don’t touch it. Its parents will often come and get it. If you’re concerned for it, it looks injured, look up your local wildlife rescue, give them a call. They’ll know what to do.

Ye olde insomnia again, so here I am, blogging at 2:30 in the morning. Fell asleep on the couch at like 8, moved to the bed shortly thereafter, work up just after midnight. Some day I’ll learn.

These photos were at the last Zero Fucks show, shortly before the quarantine came down. It was _after_ many workplaces had gone work from home, and it wasn’t super crowded because I think people were already starting to stay in. I always love going to the shows they put on, it’s such a good vibe; even this one was pretty great.

The surge is well underway here. Maybe not in the bay, but the US at large is back on that hockey stick growth in terms of new cases. Completely fucked. We should probably cancel the rest of the summer, everybody go back to staying inside as much as possible. Of course, our government is shit, and won’t lift a finger to help us, even as more people have died from COVID than two Vietnam wars. We’re gonna have to do several politically impossible things if our liberal democracy is going to make it through this. 1) has to be UBI, so people don’t have to go back to jobs that will cause more death. 2) has to be the dismantling of the police, because anything else would be inhumane. 3) is probably remove the president from office, by ballot box or by general strike, demanding his resignation (and his VP; Pence is probably worse).

I don’t know if it’s obvious from my posts here in the past, so I’m gonna say it here anyway: Black Lives Matter. Abolish the Police, tear down all the prisons, pay reparations to the descendants of slaves that built this country. And open the borders. And make all the billionaires give back what they stole. Maybe then we can stop protesting.

Just for a moment, despite the world going to hell around us, there was a little perfection. So, I was at sauced when the storms came through on tuesday. At first, everybody was on the patio, but the sky opened up and drove is all inside; even the covered areas were getting wet. Then, a few minutes later, while I was standing in line for another beer, the owner came in and told us all we had to go to the basement, there was a tornado warning. Then the sirens went off, and we all had a harrowing moment running through the rain. In the basement, they gave us all beers and told us not to worry, even as water ran down the walls. But this is oklahoma, we''re used to bad weather, so everyone took it in stride, and we even toasted the proprietor. Then, after maybe 20 minutes, we all left; the worst part of the storm had blown over. I''m drunk and things are weird right now. But what else is new? A state of profound weirdness has become normal.

had a lucky streak tonight, and everything lined up so that I was able to see and photograph comet C/2020 f3 (NEOWISE) that''s almost at peak (closest point to earth anyway). No line at the grocery store, dinner was done and eaten in time for me to check the location a friend had given, realize it was almost an hour away, get my gear together, and drive out to it. 

Then when we were there, a cop drove by the road we were parked on, came over the loudspeaker, and told everyone they had to re-park on the main road; it''s like, come on man, this happens once every seven thousand years. But whatever, he has a gun and can shoot me if he feels like it, so I move the car, grab the gear, and walk back to the same ledge, where the cop proceeds to periodically shine his stupid searchlights at us. Ugh. At least I had a lens hood. 

Spent about 20 or 30 minutes photographing. I really should have done a bunch of 1-second exposures and stacked them for the long lens; I had to do some work in photoshop to remove the slight star trails. Also, the second image is a mosaic of 3 frames, so it won''t line up perfectly with a star chart because the frames were tens of seconds apart. There is what appears to be a meteorite next to the little dipper''s handle, too. A nice bonus.

At some point in the last few weeks (maybe a month ago? time is a soup in a blender), I found a folder of images that was everything I shot from just after the trip to new york all the way through the beginning of december. So, starting from the top, here''s some stuff from Halloween night.

Current projects moving in one way or another: 

* Briefcase Bag - Doing a muslin in cordura before I use the expensive stuff. All cut, doing the assembly now. I''m not actually doing any new techniques, just recombining old tricks and a slightly different shape. Dimensions to fit a 16"MBP, in case I ever get around to buying one.
* Books - So I have almost half a dozen possible book projects, three of which spring to mind immediately, so those are probably what I''ll go with. There''s the Brazil retrospective (15 years later! god I''m old), there''s the NY synthesis book (just called "The Questions," probably), and the Dinner Club book, which I haven''t even tried to make an edit for. 
* Lathe Purchase - This is to support some of the other things I''d like to do, in particular make fixtures for a bike frame jig, and cut the tubes. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1375/0004.jpg)

Backburnered projects:

* The bike frame itself. I got to a point with my welding that I could get all the way around a joint with no blowouts consistently, and decided to conserve some material for when I was able to start up again after I make the frame jig.
* San Pablo. Had to give it a rest. It may start back up, or it may not, but in the mean time, I''ll probably cast about for a new photo-project to work on. Open to suggestions.

On some old pickup trucks, there was an option to lock the differential for use when in four wheel drive*. The idea being that one tire might slip where the others wouldn’t. You couldn’t use it for very long without unlocking, because the difference in the way the wheels spun would put twist in the axles, first loading up the drivetrain with spring tension and then causing something to break (at the right forces, any piece of steel is a spring, for at least a little bit).

But/And! impassable territory became passable, just barely. Drive, hit a rough passage, lock it down, drive a little, unlock, coast, lock, repeat, until you get past the obstacle.

That’s sort of how I feel about this here blog. when this blog is going well, there is a rhythm to it, a sort of A follows B follows C that kinda works. A smooth narrative from post to post, and sometimes I can keep that going for quite a while. But the world doesn’t fit a smooth narrative. Plans are lists of things that don’t happen. No smooth narratives here.

Let’s not think too hard about the metaphor. I’m not sure it actually extends to the territory being rough, all right? Sometimes it’s just that I get distracted by other projects, and they take over my time. Despite my efforts to never sleep, it’s still limited.

First photo is a ringer; it''s my friend''s dog Cherry. Been doing a lot of sewing work lately. I''ve got a new smaller EDC bag mostly ready for trials, as soon as I''m allowed to leave the house and take pictures. Just big enough for my leica, a couple of lenses, and maybe a snack and water bottle. I sort of have felt mildly embarrassed when I’m out somewhere, tell people I make bags, and the one I’m carrying isn’t one of mine. “No, this is just an old Domke,” isn’t a very fun answer, so I’m making one to fit that bag-shaped space. Scratching my own itch, so to speak. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1386/bloggy-2.jpg)

Another thing that just happened: I acquired the cheapest walking foot sewing machine, a [TuffSew Super Deluxe](https://tuffsew.com/product/the-straight-stitch/). I didn’t buy new, but got it for $100 on craigslist. The foot only lifts about 1/4”, the maximum stitch length is about 6mm, and if that mixing of units didn’t put you off, the noise from the machine just might. It’s a machine that lets the whole house know, SOMEONE IS SEWING SOMETHING. It did punch through 9 layers of 1000 denier nylon canvas without issue, once I got the threading right, and oiled it in all the spots that move. Oh and corrected the belt tension and fucked up one of the cams that times the feed dogs, and then fixed that. I may have to move some things around to make room for it, but that’s later today. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1386/bloggy-3.jpg)

Oh, and: the stitch length lever on it doesn’t have like, markings or a way to set and hold a stitch length, so I need to devise something for that; I may see if I can get some Sailrite parts for it, since they’re the same OEM they share the same casting and a lot of parts. The Sailrite machines are at least finished here in the US, and are probably a lot smoother. Like any offset manufacturing, there are quality and finish specifications; the degree to which fit and finish affects the final product is pretty drastic. Part of why I screwed up that cam is I was trying to add a tiny bit of play in the machine, as it was adjusted so tightly that it was almost binding up from internal forces. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1386/bloggy-4.jpg)

Anyway. As soon as I finish this bag, I’m going to start work on the web site for the three bags I intend to sell. There are three base designs, and basically those are a jumping off point. Customizable fabric, size, accessories, all made to order. The little one I’m making for myself will be the cheapest, probably in the $750 range. I haven’t decided yet. The Dyneema isn’t cheap, and neither is anything else I put into these, including my time. That’ll be at [mills.studio](https://mills.studio) which is a working domain that displays “...” and nothing else. A work in progress.

Meow fellow humans. Reporting from the millionth day in quarantine. It''s an endless Tuesday here, with cloudy skies of smoke to really intensify the isolation. So, always good to look back and remember the before times. When people could see each other without a zoom filer and within 6 feet, so as to give and receive of intimate hugs. LE SIGH. I miss people so much. 

But in other new, I made a website for my cat. www.gorbashcat.com You should check out! Let me know i you have a pet that you would like featured on his Testimonials page. just send me a pic and a quote from your pet''s point of view!

There may be a nuanced discussion to have about the difference between, say, the fire management policies of the state of california and the ongoing effects of climate change; the difference between a black swan event (I think this is number 3 or 4 of those for this year) and leading indications of trends. I''m not the guy to write those essays; I think, at this point, they''re a difference without a distinction, or vice versa. We''ve been fucking up for a while, and the time to change was 10 years ago, and now we must do everything we can (we is intentional; collective action is the only way out of this).

In case anyone is wondering: I walked around for about half an hour to shoot these, and then we drove out to the emeryville marina for the last couple. White balance was set to Lightroom''s Tungsten preset, as that struck a nice balance between too orange to see what''s going on, and what it really looked like. Shot mostly wide open, mostly on my trusty Summilux.

Remember saturdays? When you would go to the bar and just run into cool people? Yeah. This one bled over into sunday, into the bar shutting down, into us standing outside with folks while everyone smoked and waited for their rides to show up. No, mom, I wasn''t smoking. I only smoke cigars, and those only to celebrate special occasions.

It''s December now, and the light is all but gone. When I get up from my desk to pause at 4, right before plunging into the last couple hours of my day, it''s all but dark outside. No time for an after-work walk, or an evening bike ride (unless I want to ride in the cold and dark, which used to appeal to me but doesn''t as much, now).

Things are going to get worse, before they get better. But they will get better dammit! There are old people, and shitty people, who don''t want it to be true, but we''re living in the first days of a better world. We humans made a working vaccine for a virus that didn''t exist 13 months ago (well, in humans) out of fragments of RNA in _two days_. Someone sequenced the vaccine, and they emailed the damn sequence, and two days of work later, what is now the Oxford vaccine was effectively done. Of course, there''s no way to know such a thing will work until it goes through trials, but we also did that in record time.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1383/bar-before-4.jpg)

What I''m saying is, despite reactionary movements, despite setbacks, despite a whole political party determined to kill us all, we''re still here. First days of a better world.

I''ve been raising money for Odd Salon over [here](https://odd-salon.causevox.com/matt-mills). They''re a great organization, and while they''re not feeding people or engaging in direct mutual aid, I''d argue that the core mission of teaching people in an engaging way is just as essential. Maslow is bullshit; people need the arts in their lives to really be living (and if getting up in front of a rowdy crowd and giving them a history lesson, to capacity crowds once a month isn''t art, then I don''t know what is). Of course, survival first, but if you can, do.

Things are about to get dire again, if they aren''t already. We''ll be up to one 9/11 a day by mid-december if things don''t level off (and they won''t). Trump did this. The republicans in the Senate also did this. I''m not about to forgive and forget.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1384/bar-before-4.jpg)

Stay safe out there. Wear your mask if you have to leave home, but really think about it before you do. Can it wait a day? Two? Try it out. Remember surviving another day is its own victory when the enemy is a death cult bent on killing us all.

These are a little random, but they''re what''s next on the queue. I''ve always had a couple rules, unwritten, that I find myself following without thinking. One of them is that the things stay in chronological order, whatever I have in what passes for a stack to be published, and I put out the oldest first. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1385/Untitled-3-2.jpg)

Another unwritten rule: Never publish the same picture twice. This is probably the worst idea from like a self-promotion or advertising angle; good thing I''m doing neither of those. I don''t know why I do this, other than the fact that I''m constantly producing images; less so the last nine months, but I still have enough of a work backlog that I''m good for images till... sometime next year. or until things start happening again and I start generating new stuff I care about more.rr

Last fall, in the middle of the smoky season, (which was simultaneously 6 months and three lifetimes ago), we had a long weekend around my birthday and took a road trip to Tahoe. This wasn''t a normal road trip with, like, roadside stops for ice cream and the worlds largest ball of string; this was strictly drive to an AirBnB with a key code and stay there; we made a grocery run once there, and sat on a rather nice deck for most of the trip. There was also some smoke there, which wasn''t great, but at least there was different things, thinly visible behind everything.

I am woefully behind on posting, I guess? The timeliness of the posts is totally in my own head, though, and not a product of an actual need to get the photos out. No reason to rush, or to need to be timely. It''s my web site, and I''ll do what I want. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1399/0003.jpg)

A job listing popped up recently, for a staff photographer at the Chronicle. It''d be a dream job for me, but of course, it''s the sort of thing you''re supposed to work up to, after time at a smaller daily, or working as a stringer. I''ve done none of that, having refused to take a really shitty work for hire contract almost 15 years ago, and failed subsequently to find steady photo work after the 2008 financial crisis, I landed on a backup plan to the backup plan, which turned out to be pretty OK money wise but not super fulfilling otherwise. Hence the blog, the side projects, everything. I might apply, even though my qualifications are thin; it''d be good for me.

Probably nothing will happen, and I''ll end up doing something completely unexpected in 6 months. We''ll see. At least the top post on here isn''t a pepper grinder any more.

this one is so hot of the machine I''m literally still doing finishing on it, finding all the loose threads and trimming them. I''ve worn it out two days, and so far it has the hallmarks of a good performer. The main body is made from cut resistant Dyneema fabric, and lined in gridstop nylon. The custom dividers are also gridstop. The black and neon yellow accent panels are 1000d codura. All of the fabrics are coated with a waterproof layer, and while I wouldn''t use this bag as a bucket, it''s totally possible. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1387/small_one_0032.jpg)

The inside of the bag is designed to take a small mirrorless system; here it''s shown with my Leica M10, with a 50mm summilux on the front. One of the side divisions is further divided with a padded flap, allowing two lenses to be stacked on each other, but still easily accessed. Also in the main compartment is a sleeve that will fit an 11" iPad with keyboard attached. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1387/small_one_0021.jpg)

In addition to the main compartment, there are two large side pockets, with what I''ve been calling ''small object organizers'' in both, custom fitted for my needs; one holds a multitool, my pill case, and camera batteries, and the other has slots for everything from a regular pencil to an oversized sharpie. There''s still volume in these pockets for further gear, such as a small speedlight, snacks, or flashlights. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1387/small_one_0031.jpg)

Other features: a small flat pocket in the front for wallets or documents or small notebook (field notes and moleskine both fit here) and a rear large flat pocket, for the inevitable airport magazine.

So, I was having a cigar, screwing around on twitter, and I tweeted: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Man I miss taking pictures.

And well, I was sitting there and I realized that there was nothing stopping me from going on a little walk right then and there, so I did. Grabbed my camera and went on a little stroll. My left ankle and knee complained most of the way, but overall I''m really glad I went somewhere and did _something_. Vaccination and a bit more personal freedom and leeway can''t come soon enough.

In other news, I launched [the bag website](https://mills.studio) recently, to almost no fanfare at all. I don''t really know what to do to drum up customers... not my area really. I should talk to other people that make niche goods maybe.

Anyway. There are a lot of RVs parked in the hood now. I hope they''re OK, whoever might be living in them. Going to push publish and go to sleep.

So, mid September, the opportunity fell in our laps to get out of the Bay for a bit, just when it was looking like the smoke was going to hang around for another month at least. Looking back, we were absurdly cautious. We drove, so no airports; food from drive throughs wherever possible, so no sharing air; we were house and dog sitting for some friends who were taking a rafting trip down the colorado for a month, so we had a place all to ourselves. I talked about the trip [a bit before](https://matt.pictures/post/big_and_empty) but these are all new photos at least on the blog. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1404/0002.jpg)

Even with all that, the trip out was something else. I don''t know what your memories of last fall were, but mine will be of the whole western united states on fire. Not a few brush fires here and there; columns of smoke that could be seen hundreds of miles away. Pyrocumulus clouds bursting with drama. Air filters inside, and KN95 masks to walk the dog. Real end times feelings. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1404/0003.jpg)

The route we took was out I-80, through Salt Lake. Because of the time of day we always leave, we always get to the Bonneville salt flats at night, and don''t get to see much of them. This trip, on the way back, we timed it so we got there at midday. It was early November, but there will be salt flat pictures up here eventually. I just have to go and find them.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1404/0004.jpg)

There are 10 more pictures but I don''t think I have any more words tonight. Enjoy.

This bag was made after the experience of having a bunch of bags that were overfitted. Like, I knew exactly what I wanted to carry, and I''d been making bags that were _exactly_ that size. So there wasn''t any room for flexibility. One night, I just decided to throw that out the window and just make a satchel bag that had considerable wiggle room. This satchel is the result. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1417/0002.jpg)

It''ll fit an iPad 11", a medium SLR system (body + 3 lenses), various batteries and sundries. Overall dimensions are something like 12"x8.5"x4". I need to make a couple that are slightly larger, to accommodate a 13" laptop. Maybe a macbook air? or the 14" pro maybe. This design is super flexible; it can be adapted from something maybe 10x8x3 to something very large. Skinny, fat, whatever. This will be one of the two designs I launch the bag-o-matic with; this and a classic one piece messenger.

I don''t think I''ve previously published these, if I have, you''ll have to excuse me. These are from when we went to Colorado to house-sit; at the end of that trip we rented an AirBnB in Breckenridge and drove up. There was a light snowstorm that started coming down as we left Denver; coming over the pass felt a little hairy, but not nearly as bad as it looks. I''ve certainly driven in worse conditions. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1415/0002.jpg)

Some Oklahoma friends came and met us in Denver, and drove up as well. This was our substitute trip for what would have been a euro vacation for Sophia''s birthday; we''d planned on a big trip that year because we hadn''t been able to go anywhere more foreign than NYC in 2019. We all isolated for two weeks and got negative tests, we were so careful. There were a lot of unknowns for us; at the time, I don''t think we knew even that fomite transmission had been mostly ruled out. Vaccines were sometime in the future, if at all. In any case, we did it, because the risk of not going was on balance worse than staying put. I think a lot of people reached that point some time last year.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1415/0003.jpg)

People are bad at assessing risk and at the same time there comes a point when abstinence isn''t an option, you just figure out what the best mitigation strategies are to do what needs to be done, and go with that. I don''t know why I feel the need to justify myself, a lot of people were doing a lot worse than isolating in various places away from home last fall. So I''ll stop.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1415/0004.jpg)

And anyway. Mountains. Incredible snow-capped peaks. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1415/0005.jpg)

We were there before the lifts were officially open, so it was quiet, just us and the snow.

Last weekend, some friends and I went out to the state park by Mt Diablo (pretty sure it contains the mountain), had a nice picnic, and caught up for the first time in a while. I was playing around with the new lens a bit here; shooting at f/2 I think, because this was before the ND filter came in the mail. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1406/00-2.jpg)

Things about this lens: despite quite a bit of tinkering, the focus may still be off. Focusing a f/0.95 lens wide open is no joke; I think it''s a task best left for through-the-lens viewing. The focus ring turns quite a lot, giving very fine control, but working very close in, like the photo of the dog (Finley, a Good Boy), it''s possible to be off enough that focus is missed entirely. You can try bracketing, but it''s a real crapshoot with this lens. The backlash in the helical is more than the margin of error.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1406/00-3.jpg)

Also, on my sample at least, the color is very strange. A bit flat, which is some of what I''m seeing (and I''ll get to that flatness in a moment), but also with a strong green cast that I don''t understand.  The microcontrast is poor, and the sort of global contrast is also poor. It''s a spherical lens when I''ve gotten quite used to molded aspherics in everything. Of course stopped to f/4, it''s fine, because everything looks fine at f/4. 

All that said, I think it does have its place in the arsenal. Low light, high contrast situations, like shooting at night in a club, or on the street at night; it does flare badly if it''s exposed to the sun, and the built-in hood is so bad I acutaly cut it off my lens, but/and that can be good sometimes. Using this lens is an aesthetic choice you have to apply judiciously.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1406/00-4.jpg)
 
I did figure out with this lens that I should have an ND filter for my regular 50, so I can use it wide open in daylight too. I''ve been carrying it around like that for a week now, and it''s been really interesting. I always like shooting wide open, or at least I thing the pictures that come out of it are more interesting. It makes me pick what''s going to be sharp, what the focus of the picture should be. Again, probably an aesthetic choice, use at your own discretion.

So, two weeks ago now, I had a new lens in one hand, and my phone in the other. Sophie hates having her picture taken, and the real reason I got the 50mm f/0.95 was to take pictures of people, and dammit, it was Friday, I wanted to see people. So I texted Kawan, who now lives a very short distance away, to see if he was down for hangs. He was free, we were free, there''s ample outdoor space, so we went.

The idea for this bag came from goofing off on twitter. Someone was talking about being unable to find dresses in dazzle camo, and I thought, huh, I bet you could find fabric and make one pretty easy, and I went to search to pass on a link, only to find that no, nobody makes dazzle camo fabric. In fact, it''s pretty hard to pin down exactly what dazzle camo was, except very rectilinear, contrasty paint jobs. Not a lot of photos out there, at least while I was searching. So, since I had several colors of different fabric, I decided to make some. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1393/small_one_0049.jpg)

The exterior of the bag is two kinds of 1000d codura (the black and yellow stripes) and two types of Dyneema. The grey stripes are Dyneema 5oz melange, from ripstop by the roll, and the white stripes are 5oz laminate, from the same place. All of the external fabrics have a DWR coating on the inside, but are not seam sealed. The liner is 5oz dyneema melange as well (same as the gray stripes) and does have seam sealing applied internally. Should be fine in a rainstorm, don''t drop it in the ocean.

The front pockets include velcro for attaching our small object organizers (sold separately), or your own custom pouches for whatever you need always at the ready. Internally, there is a padded sleeve made to fit a 16" macbook pro. There are also strips of velcro for adding camera bag dividers, padding, or organization to the main compartment.

been a while since I did this, things started happening and they didn’t stop this time. The backog, as it stands, is at 450 pictures, maybe 7 months of shooting around. That’s a loose edit, mind; if I post half of those I’ll be surprised.

These are from a trip out to Roy’s Redwoods back in January, to hang out with Damaris and see the camera spike I made her in action. The spike is basically a 12” stainless steel rod, sharpened at one end, and with a 1/4-20 threaded hole at the other. Also, it has a handle for stepping on, to stick it in the ground. It allows a photographer to get very close to the ground very easily, especially when combined with a compact ball head. If anyone else wants one, now that I have my lathe making one is actually super easy. this one involved a really sketch setup in the drill press, and grinding the point.

There’s something about those woods in the winter, when everything is alive and moving, that is really kind of magical. I went there weekend before last with another friend (pictures TK in probably another 6 months at this rate), and it was great? a nice nature hike. Green and cool and everything you want. But during the winter, when it’s still wet, maybe even raining on you while you’re there? Magical. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1411/L1004175.jpg)

Of course, part of it is the sort of “not hiking” hiking Damaris does. It’s very slow; you go a few feet, stop, set up your camera, take pictures of something else, rinse, repeat, until you get tired of it or it’s lunchtime or whatever. _How to do Nothing_ vibes. Stopping and noticing what’s under a log. Putting it back carefully, so whoever lives there isn’t too disturbed.

The photos are once again in random order, and I can’t bring myself to care. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Holdup. Wait. Stop. Lemme back up. For years, my friend Joseph has been talking about this great place he knew, out where his friend, Jack, had a piece of mostly undeveloped land in the delta, which is what locals call the area east of where the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers come together. The first time I heard about this was probably two years ago? Everybody liked the idea of throwing a party out there, maybe a small festival, camping, cooking out. Starlight, loud music, good friends, swim in the river during the day, that sort of thing. I think the plan at the time was to make it happen the next summer. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1412/0002.jpg)

We all know what happened instead, the next summer.

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1412/0003.jpg)

This summer, though, the year of our lord 2021, the stars aligned; everyone was able to get vaccinated, Jack''s place was still standing, and he''d even put in some improvements. Solar, a shower, tomato plants that weren''t quite ripe (but growing like crazy in that heat). The place is about two hours from our house, not including waiting on the car ferry to the island. Jack had also mowed down the field around his little shack/deck arrangement where most of the action was focused, so there were nice spots for all of us to pitch our tents. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1412/0004.jpg)

We camped, we swam in the delta, we partied. The pictures cover that probably better than I could with a long essay about it, so I''m going to let them. 

# ![](https://images.matt.pictures/1412/0005.jpg)

Edit to add: this was, without doubt, the healing moment I needed after 18 months of pandemic lockdown. Thanks Jack, Joseph, Austin, Benny, Hannah, Carla, Mike, Chris, and of course, Sophie, for coming together and making it happen.

I think these are going to be in random order again, posting from my ipad so it’s a little different. i’m not gonna worry about it. Two nice portraits, taking hanging out on Kawan and Carlee’s porch last January, which I somehow still hadn’t gotten to. Plus the light on the clouds, also his porch. Then, finally, the new span of the bay bridge, seen from the nice little overlook at the end of the cycle/pedestrian walkway. It’s a good bit of exercise to get out there on the bike.
